B.R.U.T.E. Balance Adjustments,0,cu5hqj,FortNiteBR,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/cu5hqj/brute_balance_adjustments/,2334,"Heya folks,

We have made several adjustments to the B.R.U.T.E., these changes are now live in all game modes and you do not need to download or patch your client.

We will also be temporarily disabling the Junk Rift, due to an audio issue, for this weekend's FNCS tournament and Arena playlists until the 10.20 update.

**B.R.U.T.E.**

* Decreased the maximum amount of rockets fired by the B.R.U.T.E. in a single charge from 10 to 6.
* Decreased the rate at which the rockets are fired from the B.R.U.T.E. by 56%.
   * *Our goal with these changes is to increase the back and forth between the users of the B.R.U.T.E. and the players they face. These changes allow the players on the receiving end of the missile volley to have more time to react and protect themselves.*
* Decreased the radius of the B.R.U.T.E.’s rocket explosion by 42%.
   * *Our goal here is to improve consistency and understanding around focused barrages of missiles. B.R.U.T.E.s will continue to be a strong option against structures, but less lethal against players.*
* Increased the dash cooldown from 3 seconds to 5 seconds.
   * *The previous dash cooldown not only increased the B.R.U.T.E.’s mobility, but also made the B.R.U.T.E.s a harder target to hit from distance than we’d like. This adjustment reduces the ability to close gaps quickly while in the B.R.U.T.E. while also increasing the ability to land shots on target for players facing the B.R.U.T.E.*
* Decreased the velocity gained from boosting while in air by 33%.
   * *We want to reduce a B.R.U.T.E.’s ability to engage and disengage at long distances to encourage a more strategic approach to an encounter. In general we hope to shift B.R.U.T.E.s away from being highly mobile and put more emphasis on their already defensive nature.*
* The B.R.U.T.E. no longer grants materials to the driver and passenger when stomping or dashing through the environment.
   * Note: This change should roll out shortly following the other changes.
   * *Our goal is to add more tension between being in and out of a B.R.U.T.E. as well as reduce instances where players can farm faster than intended without exposing themselves to danger.*
* Adjusted the variability of spawn rates for storm phases 1, 2, and 3 in core modes. Arena spawn rates will remain unchanged.
   * Storm phase 1
      * **New spawn rates**
      * 29% chance to spawn 0.
      * 14.3% chance to spawn 1.
      * 14.3% chance to spawn 2.
      * 14.3% chance to spawn 3.
      * 14.3% chance to spawn 4.
      * 14.3% chance to spawn 5.
      * **Old spawn rates**
      * 33% chance to spawn 2.
      * 33% chance to spawn 3.
      * 33% chance to spawn 4.
   * Storm phase 2
      * **New spawn rates**
      * 25% chance to spawn 0.
      * 25% chance to spawn 1.
      * 25% chance to spawn 2.
      * 25% chance to spawn 3.
      * **Old spawn rates**
      * 33% chance to spawn 2.
      * 33% chance to spawn 3.
      * 33% chance to spawn 4.
   * Storm phase 3
      * **New spawn rates**
      * 25% chance to spawn 0.
      * 25% chance to spawn 1.
      * 25% chance to spawn 2.
      * 25% chance to spawn 3.
      * **Old spawn rates**
      * 33% chance to spawn 1.
      * 33% chance to spawn 2.
      * 33% chance to spawn 3.
   * *Previously, the early stages of a match were guaranteed a minimum amount of B.R.U.T.E.s. We’d like to provide a little more variance to that experience so that matches don’t always play out the same way. The overall average number of B.R.U.T.E.s per game is reduced slightly.*
* Decreased the material cost of using the gunner’s overshield from 200 to 75.
   * *Our goal is to further emphasize use of materials for positive defensive benefit.*
* Increased the Health of the B.R.U.T.E from 1000 to 1250.
   * *With the above changes, users of the B.R.U.T.E. need to play a bit more strategic than before, so we want to give a little bit longer of a window to do so.*

Zoe is Important for Pro-Play Because She Inhibits Stagnation,51,fy1rg2,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fy1rg2/zoe_is_important_for_proplay_because_she_inhibits/,388,"Zoe has always been a controversial Champion, and her presence in pro-play gets met with plenty of criticism. I'm here to demonstrate why she is important. To do that, I will need to make clear what I mean by ""stagnation"" in this context.

Stagnation occurs in a professional match when neither side (whether in-lane or before team fights) is willing to make a move, resulting in neither side engaging or willing to commit. Why does stagnation happen? Mostly because of the amount of damage in the game. Due to the high stakes inherent to a professional match, pro-players are very cautious, because even a single death can have profound consequences. This has resulted in some lackluster play in the past, where both teams simply bide their time by farming. High damage trickles through every part of the game, having effects like reducing vision; impacting Jungle, Support, and Toplane; and snowballing.

&#x200B;

Zoe, however, is a Champion that can avoid having lanes stagnate and can trigger the advancement of a match.

During the laning phase, stagnation can occur if both laners mutually agree to minimize engaging against each other and instead give greater focus on farming. It is through the intervention of another team member (such as a Jungler) that would typically bring this stagnation to an end. Zoe, however, can earn Spell Shards by getting the last hit on balloon minions, and these Spell Shards can give her the opportunity to engage. Therefore, laning as ***or*** against Zoe is never stagnant, as the state of the battlefield can change at any moment. If you ignore Zoe while laning against her, you may find yourself outgunned when a Spell Shard drops. With this in mind, the enemy laner knows they must interact with Zoe, and thus stagnation is avoided.

Outside of laning phase, stagnation can occur at the edge of a team fight, particularly around objectives. It's not uncommon for both teams to prepare for a team fight, such as around the Dragon or Baron, with both sides nervously milling about for an opportunity to make a move. Zoe, on the other hand, does not play this way. With her ability to apply meaningful damage, if she is able to land her skillshots against a member of the enemy team, this creates an opening for her team to act. The enemy team, meanwhile, is aware that they cannot simply allow this to happen, so they must engage before Zoe can do this. And thus stagnation is avoided.

&#x200B;

Zoe is important to have in professional play for one more reason: Spell Thief. As it stands, Zoe is the only Champion in the game who acts as a deterrent to and punishes the irresponsible use of Summoner Spells and item-actives. If Zoe is not in the game, the enemy team is free to use them however they wish.

However, if Zoe ***is*** in the game, then if the enemy is heedlessly using Summoner Spells and item-actives, it will provide Zoe with many more tools to use against them. This results in players having to be more thoughtful of the consequences when they use their Flash and Zhonya's and anything else. Let me repeat that: ***the presence of Zoe in a game makes the enemy team need to be more thoughtful in how they play***. This is a good thing. Being able to use a bunch of extra effects from Summoner Spells and item-actives gives players too many ways to increase their impact without any repercussions. Zoe changes that, as she can and will punish those who drop Spell Shards irresponsibly.",1586470045.0,jayjaybird0,True,False,False,0.51,51,4088601

* Fixes that should improve overall game stability to reduce crashes.

&#x200B;

**WEAPON BALANCE**

**Disruptor Rounds with Alternator:**

* Reduced Shielded damage multiplier 1.7 -> 1.55.
   * *Designer Notes: Disruptor rounds on the alternator are shredding shields a bit too quickly and still proving to be stronger than intended, so we're reducing the disruptor rounds multiplier on shield damage*.

**RE-45:**

* Increased Magazine Size for all tiers to the following:
   * Base: 16
   * Common: 19
   * Rare: 22
   * Epic: 25
   * *Designer Notes: We’re giving the RE-45 a small boost in power by giving it one more round for every mag size. Downing a non-fortified enemy with the RE-45 with 0, 50, 75, and 100 shields requires 10, 14, 16, and 19 shots respectively, so this extra round gives the gun the ability to one-mag more armored enemies instead of leaving them barely alive.*

**R-301:**

* Increased vertical and horizontal recoil. Slightly increased recoil pattern randomness.
   * *Designer Notes: We’ve made these changes as we’ve seen that the R301 is a bit stronger than intended at long range. We’ve adjusted recoil to balance keeping it effective at medium to close range--which is the original intent--but it should be more difficult for players to auto fire and still laser enemies at long distances.*

**LEGENDS**

**General**

* Made adjustments to Pathfinder’s and Low-Profile Legends hitboxes.
   * Taking shots to the hip now does torso damage instead of leg damage. This should more closely match the behavior of the other Legends.
* Fixed a bug where activating a healing item would cancel the Ultimate for Legends that need to prime it \[Bangalore / Pathfinder / Caustic / Gibraltar / Bloodhound\]
* Fixed an exploit where players would sometimes be able to still shoot while downed.

**Bloodhound**

* Increased the distance that Bloodhound can see traversal clues left by other players \[but not other kinds of clues\] to 25 meters.
* Adjusted the area of effect for Bloodhound’s Tactical to 125 fov.

**Wraith**

* Based on player feedback, we’ve reduced the “hum” audio that’s playing while using Wraith’s Kunai.
* Fixed issue where actions for Wrath would have a slight delay when her weapon is holstered and crouching or sliding while the kunai is equipped.
* Fixed an exploit that allowed players to remove the cooldown for Wraith’s Tactical Ability.

**Mirage**

* Fixed bug where Mirage was able to stay invisible and still be able to shoot and melee when using his Ultimate on a zipline.

**Octane**

* Fixed bug where sometimes Octane’s Jump Pad would not launch the player.",1565716044.0,Jayfresh_Respawn,True,False,False,0.55,577,958496

I am so sick of all the toxic BS and falsehoods flying around on various subreddits towards Warren. I have made my choice for the Primary and it's Elizabeth Warren.,9,ep4qit,ElizabethWarren,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/ep4qit/i_am_so_sick_of_all_the_toxic_bs_and_falsehoods/,230,"As a day one Bernie supporter, I have been greatly disappointed by the way the Sanders campaign has allowed gaslighting, lies, and toxic propaganda to spread over the internet on their behalf.  It breaks my heart to see it coming from the community that I once loved to be a part of.  However, I feel quite strongly that if you permit such activities to continue on your behalf with out rebuke, you might as well be engaged in them yourself.

You don't have to look very far to see whole hordes of people trafficking in misconceptions and falsehoods about Warren's plans, proposals, motives and so on.  It ridiculous and depressing.  We should stick together and unite over our common goals, not slander and try to bring each other down.  NO ONE is served by our division except the enemies of progress.  

I have fully committed to supporting Warren for 2020 and I donated accordingly.

Edit:  To be clearly I would support Bernie or any D in the general.

Edit 2: Those of you who are visiting from other subreddits that seem to be confused or are purposefully ignoring the majority of my comment.  My feeling toward the aforementioned toxicity, lying, and gaslighting is not generated from the events of the last few days or my feelings towards Sanders or any one candidate in general.  Rather, it's the community at large that is taking cues from media outlets and running with them well beyond their limit.  

Things like...

Calling Warren a snake, who is in the pocket of banks, when in fact she founded the CFPB.  

Saying that she lied about her support for M4A, when she merely released a plan to tackle it in the way she felt would be the most successful.

Attacking her level of education and labeling her as smug elietist.  

Or denying her the label of progressive all together for no meaningful reason.

You know what, I don't see Warren supporters pulling this BS.  Everyone I have seen, read, heard from, and talked to is all on board with the progressive movement and working together with Sanders.   The fact that since I have posted this there have been comments and messages degrading me for my choice and calling Warren a 'snake' is no surprise.  So for anyone who is confused or doubting the validity of my comments, feel free to peruse any of the popular political subs on reddit and you'll see what I mean.

We need to unite and the first step is acknowledging that there is a problem.

ALSO, like many here have suggested, it most likely that the contentious 'conversation' about women presidents most likely DID happen, but was referring to the inherent challenge rather than being discriminatory.  I don't think either candidate has handled this particularly great and it should be a lesson to both of them and to us.  Also fuck the media.",1579106975.0,JoJoVonAnthro,True,False,False,0.5,9,30329
For all the new folks coming here,84,dfv1fs,Sino,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sino/comments/dfv1fs/for_all_the_new_folks_coming_here/,354,"Reposting since it looks like our sub is getting a lot of attention again.  Updated with recent context.

\--------------------------------------

First, welcome to [/r/sino](https://www.reddit.com/r/sino/). Even if you're here from a brigading subreddit, welcome to the sub, and please participate in good faith. We don't want to shut you guys out - we want to hear your perspective as well, as long as you follow the rules of the subreddit and engage in meaningful discussion.

With that out of the way, you may be coming here with a set of preconceived notions around China or this subreddit due to the recent Hong Kong protests and follow-on social media manipulation efforts. If so, let me be clear: **I am happy to engage, and most of the posters here would be too**. No beliefs you come with will make me think less of you - on [/r/sino](https://www.reddit.com/r/sino/), the only criterion we judge each other by is our ability or inability to gather the truth from facts.

Indeed, if you come in here hating China because China banned the NBA or Blizzard ""appeased"" China, I want to engage with you.  Hell, I don't agree that banning an entire sports league for a Twitter statement by a single executive is the right way for the world to hear China's grievances on Hong Kong - and that this post is staying on this sub should show you that we embrace free speech.

If you came in here hating the Chinese Communist Party because you read a skewed article from taiwannews or the Hong Kong Free Press, I want to engage with you, because you are a victim of propaganda. If you want to downvote everything positive about China or the Chinese government because you saw your friends or fellow citizens get tear gassed and shot with beanbag rounds, I want to engage even more, because you are a victim of political tension in Hong Kong caused by both the US and Chinese governments. These last few weeks have made us all angry, no doubt, but together, we can heal and find a better way forwards.

You may ask why I care. To me, this is personal.

My family originated out of four individuals that fought for China. Not all on the same side, mind you. The first repurposed the family factories to making bullets to fight the Japanese. The second returned home from studying engineering in the US to design machine tools and assembly lines for the war effort. A third played cat and mouse with Japanese and KMT death squads in Shanghai, setting up dozens of cells for the Communist Party and dodging three arrest attempts before she was finally smuggled to safety. The fourth, he fought **for** Chiang, carrying and bleeding upon the Blue Sky White Sun flag in desperate rearguard actions to win time for refugees fleeing the genocidal Imperial Japanese Army. And, tragically, when the Japanese surrendered, they fought each other. But in the end, they - and their siblings - all fought for their shared dream of a new China - as staff officers and scientists; financiers, industrialists, and politicians in both parties.

Afterwards, they ended up scattered between Singapore, the United States, Taiwan, and the mainland. Some of them were purged and imprisoned by the KMT or CCP. When they first met in the 80s, many of them hadn't seen each other for decades. That day, they didn't agree on much, except for three things: stay away from politics if you can, but if push comes to shove, China is always worth fighting for - and foreigners will always try to split China by taking advantage of those who care about China.

For most of my life, I have followed their first rule. I've stayed quiet. But in the last few years, predatory forces have gathered on the doorstep of China to rob the Chinese people of everything they have built over the last four decades - and the divisions and scars that mark the Chinese soul are the easiest way for them to do it. I now realize - on behalf of my grandparents who bled for this land - it is imperative to heal those scars. Because they were right on the second and third as well.

Because the China you live in - no matter whether you call it Beijing or Hong Kong or Shanghai or Taipei - is your home. **It belongs to you, and you own it.**

Because the China you see was built with the blood, sweat, and tears of the Chinese people - your mother, your father, your brothers, your sisters, and **you**. Your hard work made this possible. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise.

Because how tragic it would be, if the foreign bastards made you spill blood against your own flesh and blood so that they could come in and loot it all.

**Because how pitiful you would be**, if you just sat back and let it happen, or even encouraged it with your own misbegotten anger.

Because the China of today stands for more than what Radio Free Asia paints it as - it stands for providing a **good life for its citizens, no matter what**, and **attempting to give the World an example to follow, rather than an overseer's whip ordering the World around.**

Because China is worth fighting for, and we must protect China, together - support her when she is right, chastise her when she is wrong, and cherish her, always. And no matter how you think that ought to be accomplished - as long as you have the Chinese people in your heart, you are always welcome in mine, and welcome to this sub.

"I’m Stefan Thomas and I introduced millions of people to Bitcoin, was in charge of the technology for the third largest cryptocurrency, and hate blockchain. AMA!",0,buuxws,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/buuxws/im_stefan_thomas_and_i_introduced_millions_of/,936,"Hello!

My name is Stefan Thomas. I started programming when I was four years old and have been addicted to it ever since.

Starting in 2010, I got involved with Bitcoin, produced the [“What is Bitcoin?” video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo) that introduced millions of people to Bitcoin, and created [BitcoinJS](https://github.com/bitcoinjs), the first implementation of Bitcoin cryptography in the browser.

My dream was to make crypto-currency mainstream, so in 2012 I joined a startup called [Ripple](https://ripple.com/). I told them that I wanted to be a coder only, and not a manager. Eight months later, they made me CTO. While I was there, we built a blockchain that is 200x faster, 1000x cheaper, and vastly more energy-efficient than Bitcoin. The underlying cryptocurrency, XRP, is now the third-largest in the world.

I think cryptocurrency is a powerful idea, politically and economically. But managing a blockchain system at scale sucks. A shared ledger, by definition, is a tightly coupled system, something we engineers spend much of our time trying to avoid, with good reason. So what comes after blockchain?

[Interledger](https://interledger.org/) is a (non-blockchain) payment protocol I helped create in 2015. Interledger is able to process transactions faster, and at a much larger scale than blockchain systems. It’s closer to something like TCP/IP - it has no global state and passes around little packets of money similar to how IP passes around packets of data.

Last year, I founded a company called [Coil](https://coil.com/). We’re using Interledger to create a better business model for creators on the Web. Instead of putting a company in the middle like Spotify or Netflix, we’re putting an [open standard](https://webmonetization.org/) in the middle and companies like ours compete to provide access. Some members of our community created a subreddit at [r/CoilCommunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoilCommunity/).

Android users, Please suggest some of your alternative reddit apps that strip out adds below and I'll be happy to edit my post to include them.

Now that's out of the way lets get to the meat and potatoes of the issue.

# Andrew Yang:

Yang supports the following 2nd amendment infringements:

* [Responsible gun owners should continue to enjoy the right to bear arms, subject to licensing and education requirements](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/gun-safety/). This man wants you to have a license to exercise your 2nd amendment unalienable right. Licensing leads to registration, registration leads to confiscation. Don't believe me? Look at Canada. Bill [C-71](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/PublicWebsite/default/en_CA/ResearchPublications/LegislativeSummaries/421C71E) not only authorizes bans of handguns but lays groundwork for a ""mandatory buyback."" Anybody who is not a complete muppet knows that ""mandatory buyback"" is a more palatable way of saying confiscation.
* He also supports a tiered licensing program where owners of automatic or ""advanced"" (of course he does not go into what ""advanced"" means) weapons [would need to submit their fingerprints and DNA to the FBI, and undergo inspections of their government mandated gun locker.](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/andrew-yang/)
* He also supports [""smart guns"" and universal background checks](https://www.vox.com/2019/8/7/20756698/democratic-presidential-candidates-gun-violence-mass-shootings).

# Bernie Sanders:

This undercover communist supports the following: ([this one was easy, I didn't even have to leave his campaign site.](https://berniesanders.com/issues/gun-safety/))

* ""Expanded"" background checks.
* Ban the sale and distribution of ""assault"" weapons
* Prohibit high-capacity ammunition magazines (funny how democrats constantly misspell standard capacity mags)
* Support “red flag” laws and legislation

# Marxist, pinkos, and commies:

This one is also easy, y'all LOVE defaulting to the following quote:

>“Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be  surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by  force if necessary.”– [Karl Marx, March, 1850](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm)

I've made this analogy here many of times and I'll make it again. Your wold view is like the worksheets from physics 101. Everything is a constant and drag does not exist, everything just works. Sorry to bring you back to reality but the real world does NOT WORK THAT WAY. Point me to **ONE just ONE** socialist or communist government that allowed their ""workers"" aka slaves to stay armed and protected their right of self preservation. Last time I checked the USSR, China, Venezuela, Cuba, Vietnam, The ""democratic"" peoples republic of korea, and Laos do not allow their people to own firearms. Please explain this **glaring** **discrepancy**, I'll wait.......

&#x200B;

In short, if you support any of the people above you aren't pro gun. You cant be pro gun and endorse politicians that are hell bent and essentially brag about how their plan to infringe on your unalienable and constitutionally protected rights. If politicians bragging about taking steps to strip you of your natural rights does not send and ice cold chill down your spine, you aren't pro gun. If you don't believe the fact that the founding fathers wrote the second amendment as a fail safe to protect the citizens of our republic from a tyrannical government, you are not pro gun. If you believe that we should only have ""hunting guns"" because the government can do no wrong... you aren't pro gun. If you believe that you need a ""license"" to protect yourself or your family from threats foreign and domestic(yes this includes our own government) ... you are not pro gun.

As an American you should have a hard coded innate distrust in government. Our founding fathers had such a distrust in government and authority that they guaranteed our ability to defend ourselves from it and they were our nation's first presidents. If you truly poses this distrust like I and many here do, I don't see how you can willingly vote for politicians willing to expand the power of government by stripping the peoples ability to keep our government in check.

**Remember that our government should be scared of us not the other way around.**

The enemy team counterpicks with AA and Gorg cries about being countered that he mutes and bans Inkop (the guy who counter picked him) from his chat. This results in Inkop abandoning the game during the picking phase to save Gorg from a potential loss.

Suspended On The Last Day Of My Grand Marshal Grind Without Explanation,0,g8o0ke,classicwow,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/g8o0ke/suspended_on_the_last_day_of_my_grand_marshal/,305,"Hi everyone,

Long time reader, first time poster on this subreddit. My name is Maahes and I play on Thunderfury Alliance. I am here to plead for your help and support. I woke up this morning to grind the final 30k of honor of my Grand Marshal journey that began so long ago. I joined an Arathi Basin match this morning and as I was capping Farm I was disconnected from the game and confronted by a message that my account has been suspended for 8 days. I quickly check my email to find that I have somehow been reported for ""disruptive game play"" with no explanation. I have never had a disciplinary against my account dating back to Vanilla. Any member of the Thunderfury community can attest to me being a helpful and compassionate player.

As everyone knows the grind for Grand Marshal / High Warlord is grueling and very taxing on a player. I have been playing 16-18 (sometimes 20+) hours a day to grind the honor required to reach this rank and to have it taken away without an explanation is very disheartening. Being suspended for 8 days will keep me from reaching cap this week and I will decay Ranking Points. Not being able to play an entire week will cause more decay. The result is an additional 3 weeks of 16-18 hour of PVPing days to get back to where I am today. This is likely not something I can endure. Anyone that has tried to rank to GM knows the journey takes an incredible toll on your body, your personal life, and your professional life.

I would like to request from those of you that have experienced this or can empathize with my situation to please up-vote for visibility. Ultimately, I’m seeking clarity as to why I was suspended and to hopefully get this resolved. I have already submitted an appeal to Blizzard but do not know if they will respond. I know that other players have had luck in getting their cases reviewed and overturned because the community rallied behind them and Blizzard reviewed the case to realize they made an error.

Thank you for your time and help.

Sincerely,

Maahes of Thunderfury

"Heterosexuality Is A Misleading Term For ""No Homo""-Moids. Men Do Not Feel Attracted To Women, They Do Not Like Women, And They Do Not Love Women.",0,g0gzc0,PinkpillFeminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinkpillFeminism/comments/g0gzc0/heterosexuality_is_a_misleading_term_for_no/,195,"**1.) Men are not attracted to women.**

Men constantly talk about how disgusting vaginas look, smell, taste, and how much they hate the idea of going down on women. If they have the choice, they prefer female genitals that are mutilated: either via ""old-fashioned"" techniques like in some African and Islamic communities or via ""modern"" cosmetic surgeries that some women in porn have performed on them. The goal of this is always a kind of sexless, ""genitalless"", pedophilic look of a pink little slit.

Men also hate any amount of natural body hair on women although (or because!) it is a sign of sexual maturity. Men hate normal amounts of body fat on women although (or because) it is a sign of sexual maturity and fertility as well.

Men want babies with big tits.

And what do they want to sexually do to these babies with big tits? Fuck them in the ass, fuck them in the throat, beat, rape, torture, and humiliate them until they cry.

Male sexuality is nothing but fetishized violence against women. They love anal sex because it is hurtful to women and doesn't give women a chance to orgasm themselves. And the moment they realized that some women actually enjoy giving blowjobs have they come up with ""throat fucking"" and ""deep throat"": they HATE women, they HATE female bodies, and they HATE the idea that a woman could enjoy sex.

It is often said that ""Porn tells lies about women, but it tells the truth about men"". And the truth is that if you take the brutal anal/throat penetration out of male sexuality, what's left is men casually beating, hurting, whipping women. The distinction between ""vanilla"" and ""kink"" doesn't make sense in the case of men. It's just a matter of degree. ""Vanilla"" men want to rape women and beat them - ""kinky"" men want to rape women and beat them and electroshock and water torture and mutilate them.

Men are not attracted to actual female bodies. Men only enjoy the idea of DESTROYING female bodies: both through absurd beauty norms that effectively destroy these bodies and turn them into absurd dolls and through sexual practices that are always about hurting, beating, whipping, raping, anal fucking, throat fucking female bodies.

Men are MONSTERS. There is some creepy shit in nature: viruses and predators and parasite larvae that eat their host alive. And, of course, other animals also rape women. But nothing is as cruel and disgusting as the human moid: at least a lion doesn't masturbate over the idea of a female lion being torn to pieces by an elephant or whatever. A predator just wants to eat you, a coronavirus just enter a cell nucleus and replicate ... but the human moid gets erections and masturbates to the thought of women being humiliated and tortured and hurt until they cry and bleed or even die.

**2.) Men do not like women.**

Men do not feel attracted to real women. And men do obviously not LIKE women. They hate women so much that the moment women like something, men hate it: if women like flavored-coffee drinks from Starbucks, men hate it BECAUSE women like it. (As if bacon and bacon memes are funnier or better than women making memes about pizza or enjoying pumpkin-spice lattes!)

If women join a fandom, men leave because the moment women like it, they start hating it. Some sociologist has coined the term ""gender pollution"": it is a sexist term itself but it describes a real phenomenon: the more women enter a particular space (e.g. a profession or a hobby), the more it is ""polluted"", the less it is valued and the less people in this job get paid. I think in some Eastern European countries this is actually the case with doctors even: but as there are many women in this field - both among nurses as well as among doctors - doctors are also not valued anymore.

The moment women became good in school was the moment boys increasingly dropped out. Men now associate doing your homework and reading books with women - and they rather ruin their lives than to be engaged with something women like! So instead of doing their homework are they now playing video games 24/7. But now women have obviously started playing video games as well. So now they become mass shooters because they hate the idea of female video game characters.

**3.) Men do not love women**

Winston Churchill famously said that you have the Germans either at your feet or at your throat. 

Now, I’m not sure about the Germans, but I think that this is definitely true for males: they are always either at your throat or at your feet. Males fall in ""love"" with e-girls … but the moment they find out that those women already have boyfriends they want to kill them. (I’m not even sure if I have to put ""love"" in quotation marks here because the idea of a REAL love in contrast to quotation-marks-love feels a bit like the idea that only ""men"" in quotation marks are toxic and shitty while REAL men are all these heroes and these supermen…)

I think pornsickness and “lovesickness” are, in a way, two sides of the same coin. “Love” feels like the surrogate religion of a secular age. I’m not a Buddhist but I agree with this part from a text, explaining why this religion is critical of the concept of “romantic love”: 

&#x200B;

>*The love of a man for a woman and a woman for a man is often the floor to which people fall after the collapse of other dreams. It is held to be solid when nothing else is, and though it frequently gives way and dumps them into a basement of despair, it still enjoys a reputation of dependability. No matter that this reputation is illogical — it still flourishes and will continue to flourish regardless of what is said in any book.* ***Love, or possibly the myth of love, is the first, last, and sometimes the only refuge of uncomprehending humanity.*** *What else makes our hearts beat so fast? What else makes us swoon with feeling? What else renders us so intensely alive and aching? The search for love — the sublime, the nebulous, the consuming — remains sacred in a world that increasingly despises the sacred. When the heroic and the transcendental are but memories, when religious institutions fill up with bureaucrats and social scientists, when nobody believes there is a sky beyond the ceiling, then there seems no other escape from the prison of self than the abandon of love. With a gray age of spiritual deadness upon us, we love, or beg for love, or grieve for love. We have nothing higher to live for.*

I couldn’t agree more. Just consider how many males murder others and/or end their own lives because of love. Just like being pornsick makes it hard for males - and for women - to develop a realistic understanding of human sexuality with its possibilities and limitations, being “lovesick” makes it hard for males - and for women - to develop a realistic understanding of human relationships. People these days expect love to do what previous generations expected miracles and gods to do. “All you need is love” vs “All you need is Jesus”.

There are also studies that show that males fall in love easier and earlier than women. And they surely fall *out of* love easier as well. Males are like the flickering flame of a candle that burns brightly for a second and then goes out again. This is why it’s so super common for women to think that they do not know their husbands anymore because they feel that these males are completely different persons suddenly. 

Males can be lovesick and pornsick at the same time. They masturbate to torture porn in one moment, and the next moment they write a 20-page love letter to some e-girl and emotionally vomit all over them, confessing their undying love. (Many women receive as many rape threats as they receive cringe love letters in which males emotionally vomit all over them.) And one moment later do they already want to kill those terrible “e-thots” again: males are always either at your throat or at your feet: the romantic concept of ""love"" is a literary construct at best and a religious tool at worst but it's simply not true that men are able to ""love"" women in the sense women dream about being loved.

Did you know that Lee Sin's most common gank combo doesn't involve hitting a skillshot at all, but instead he has enough damage from R-Q due to damage powercreep from buffs and runes and new items to no longer need to hit an ability to kill you? It's also pretty easy to get in range to use it, since he has a dash from W and is in the third highest MS bracket at 345 (more-or-less second highest, since only two champions -- Pantheon and Yi-- are 355). 

It seems curious that he's been such a dominant champion in all of soloQ and all of competitive for so long but there hasn't even been a whisper of nerfs towards him yet. You'd expect his winrate to be much lower in soloQ too, given that he's supposed to be a hard to play champion.",1585447693.0,Magehunter_Skassi,True,False,False,0.53,69,4088601
Do I have a free car?,37,bwkkk3,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bwkkk3/do_i_have_a_free_car/,48,"FROM: California, USA. 

So the small amount of background to this story is that, I recently (3 months ago) leased a new car. After three months of no bills, I checked in, and figured out the following had happened to the contract. 

When filing the contract with the auto dealer, Nissan kicked back the contract because of a very small error ($1.75 tax in Cali per tire, but they taxed a 5th, backup tire that my car doesn’t come with). They sent it back to the dealership to be fixed, but in that time, the dealership was sold to someone else. 

The lease was pretty much in limbo, with really being in no place at the time that it had been sold. Nissan didn’t have it, and the new company didn’t have it. 

Now, the new dealership is sending us a contract to be signed. Do we have any legal obligation to sign, or could we just go down to the DMV and remove them from the lease, since there’s no contractual evidence that gives them any ownership over the car?

It’s obvious that people think I’m trying to defend myself in my comments but what I’m really trying to do is offer more information. It’s obvious from the conversations I’ve had with the new dealership that they don’t have a legal claim to the car, and that’s what I’ve attempted to describe.

A Chinese take on this...,0,dhxgx6,hearthstone,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dhxgx6/a_chinese_take_on_this/,772,"  

If you are already angry reading the title and shout racist slurs or “get the fuck out 50cent army” then this post is not for you. I trust I should have some faith in the gaming community. 

After seeing and hearing so much I think I have a say in this. 

I am a Chinese British citizen, born and raised in China later immigrated to the UK, have spent over 15 years in both countries, well versed in social and political issues and themes in both cultures. And above all, a hardcore gamer. PC and console (PS2 in the past now Xbox), lost count of games I have played, probably well over 500 by now. 

And of course I was a die-hard Blizzard fan. Started with Warcraft 3, Starcraft (fun memories of Chinese Internet cafes lol), Diablo 1,2, then WoW, then Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3 in the last few years etc… 

**Blizzard in the West**

I said “was”, because I have seen the downfall of blizzard. Let me get this straight first, **I really hate the Chinese influence of gaming** in the West. Here, I mean gaming in general: micro-transactions, artistic direction (apparently some of the Hearthstone tuning of gore etc as of late). I, too, enjoyed the early days of PS2 story-driven, free unlockables, and limitless replayability without extra cost, no “early access”, “surprise mechanics”. It is absolutely disgraceful to see the likes of EA and Activation scamming young children and getting people addicted. 

China has a lot to blame for this, because of its monetary influence in these Western publishers. 

To me, and a lot of my gamer friends here in the UK, Blizzard have gone down hill since Diablo 3. They have become more money driven and egregious with their practices. With the merger of Activation and their public listing, I don’t need to say much more, I think we all know how to feel about the whole entity as a whole at present. 

**Blizzard in China**

If you grew up in China in the 90’s like me, you will know how much influence Blizzard games had on our generation. Briefly mentioned above, Internet cafes used to be absolutely rampant in the country. If you know anything about China, in the 90s’, it was very poor (many are still today as well), even in big cities where Internet cafes were present. So IP wasn’t a thing. Millions of pirate copies of Starcraft and Warcraft 3 (among many other popular RTS and first person shooters) were what the owners depended their livelihood of. Now IP is much more strongly protected in entertainment industry as a whole, my generation feel the guilt towards Blizzard. Blizzard made their childhood memories but we all stole from them. So microtransactions in something like Hearthstone could make money off people so easily (as someone who never spends a penny on these I was absolutely gobsmacked to hear a Chinese friend of mine dropping the equivalent of $300 into Hearthstone to just to get in). 

**Mobile Gaming**

Mobile gaming is so popular in China because of a number of reasons. To keep a simple: 1. They are not exposed to the “real gaming” we have the privilege to be. Like many in this community know, media control is ridiculous. Most of what you hear on the Internet about “Great Wall of China” is true, so I don’t need to elaborate; 2. Mobile cellular technology is more advanced in China, arguably more than the UK and US, even in the country side; 3. Lifestyle of people in cities are much more fast paced; 4. Most important, combined with number 1, no developer/publisher have the political or monetary power to compete with the giants such as Tencent and Netease. The likes of these most probably have a lot of say along with the official governmental bodies which give entertainment production the “go-ahead” to the marketplace. Yes, corruption can be involved. But maybe as a whole, the country may not be as corrupt as many may think (especially having seen how some gamers describe China since the incident). 

**Hong Kong is No Laughing Matter**

If you are Chinese, AND British like me, you wouldn’t be very rushed to making a conclusion on making a stance.

But I think, we, in the gaming community can sometimes be slightly naïve about geo-politics. After all, we game to escape from the reality, I get it. But hear me out.  

Many seem to be unaware, how HK was a colony of the British Empire in the first place. Put it simply, two Opium Wars. What are the Opium Wars? Quick links here: ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium\_Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_Wars))

Basically the arrogant Qing Dynasty wouldn’t trade with any Western powers, so the empires sold the Chinese opium in order to open its gates. The Qing government tried to fight against them, but failed, signed the treaty and gave up Hong Kong. In the late Qing Dynasty, opium problem was epidemic in the country. All men smoked it and it fucked up the country. Government was corrupt, Chinese citizens were hopeless, if you are interested, just google “Century of Humiliation”.

The Brits ruled it for 156 years, introduced rule of law, capitalism. All good things of course, especially when China was controlled by the Communist Mao in the 20th century. But make no mistake, its prosperity is not because of its freedom, it’s because China was closed up (internal political turmoil etc.. more on this, search “Cultural Revolution”). 

Since 1997 the handover, China joined the WTO, cities like Shen Zhen and Guang Zhou gradually took the economic position of HK. Why would a Western company go to HK when it could directly reach over 1 billion consumers, so HK gradually became less relevant. 

For those of us that think HK was “free” under the UK rule, allow me to say you might be misled. A quick comparison: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong\_Kong\_1967\_leftist\_riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_1967_leftist_riots), the HK police killed 51 people in the 1967 extreme leftist riot (or I could call “patriotic demonstration” if I was biased). And, most importantly, HK citizens never had universal suffrage under the British rule. The UK government thought they were “democratic”, because it was democratic in the British parliament, which directly appointed the Chief Executive of HK.  

China has been gradually extending its “claws” into HK’s political and legislative system, I agree, hence I am supportive of the initial march by millions of citizens. But at the same time China is not as totalitarian as many make it out to be. I wish HK’s rule of law and relative freedom of speech never goes away, but I am also aware, Hong Kong (and especially Hong Kong) is and should always be China’s Hong Kong. 

I am over simplifying here, it’s a gaming community after all. But more on this, feel free to challenge/provide your thoughts.  

**Western Reaction on the Matter**

What happened, is a clash to cultures. 

After watching the most vocal gaming YouTubers’ reaction on the matter, YongYea, The Quertering, AngryJoe, Jimquisition, Layman Gaming, HeelvsBabyface etc., it made me realise that the Western gaming community at large can be quite politically unaware.

All of these guys I absolute admire, I subscribe to them, voice of the community, absolutely. But I don’t agree with some of their direct/indirect encouragement of protesting for “freedom of HK”.  

For some reason, the US and UK reaction of the HK matter has been the most one-sided story I have seen since my day one in UK. So to this degree, I don’t blame anyone’s responsive stance to stand for HK. But if you are really curious, I suggest you to google around, try to see the other side of the story on YouTube, see how other democratic Chinese spoken societies (Taiwan, Singapore) react to the whole thing, and what extreme violence has been committed lately, and also think, if the same thing happened here in the UK or US, what would the police do. 

I think making fun of Blizzard and China’s Pooh can be fun, but I think this advocacy can be “cheap”, we have very little to lose, but if people get really misled politically, many could die (need I say more). 

Note earlier I said “clash of cultures”. Believe me, a lot of reaction coming from mainland China towards NBA, South Park, Blizzard are not made by the government. Much of it is very negative, extreme even. I don’t agree the kind of rhetoric, but I can understand the rationale. 

To most of Chinese people, family is the upmost political correctness, like the Freedom of Speech, or Race Equality. To many, the unity of the country and the culture is the bigger “family”. So separate a part from its land is a fantasy, just like genocide is unimaginable now in today’s UK or USA. China has been relatively “homogenous”. The Chinese don’t value the latter two as much, because it didn’t have race relation troubles in its history, at least in the last 200 years. But if Race Relations cannot be kept in the USA, the country would break apart. If you don’t believe me, ask a Singaporean Chinese, Malaysian Chinese, Taiwanese Chinese, or even a British/American born Chinese, how important the unity of culture and the unity of family is to them.  

So for a foreign entity (like NBA or potentially Blizzard), who do not understand anything I have said above, to say stand with HK, is the greatest insult to the Chinese people. Hence the reaction or likely reaction in Blizzard’s case. 

I agree, that Chinese people are more sensitive on some issues than they should be, and not just boycott everything that touches their feelings. But again, you have to understand what it has been through in the last 200 years. And just a thought, how many countries have China invaded ever?  

This is why the Chinese think we the West are the bully and downright ignorant, and why we in the West think the Chinese commies are the bully.  

**Blizzard’s Weibo Post**

From the wording of the original post, in Chinese, I can see that it was probably written by a Chinese official. Mark Kern highlighted this in his live stream with The Quartering, and I think he might be right. The tone is very much a communist official’s tone, just like the kind you see on everyday media in China. But I think this is Blizzard using its “China knowledge”, because it understands the market (as per above), so doing the pre-damage controlling. I also think they should have just pulled him off behind the scene and warn him like many YouTubers suggested, instead of all guns-blazing using Weibo to please the Chinese gamers. Blizzard underestimated the power of internet and people’s willingness to research in general. 

**How We Should Move On**

Finally, if you have been with me this far, I hope this gives you some insight. I am not telling you to not stand with HK, at the end of day that is your freedom. I am simply providing some insight and background to the whole story. I just think if you do, be aware of what you stand for, and why. Personally, both democracy and Freedom of Speech are relative. I enjoy voting for my government here in the UK, and I enjoy writing this post here on Reddit (probably not possible in China), but I also believe in reason, as well as the “overall positive attitude and hopefulness of the majority Chinese people under the regime”. Ask any foreign person who has been or lived in China. 

As for the Western game developer/publishers, including Blizzard, I think they should focus on the games first, not country. This is why Blizzard got so big in the first place in China, because it made good games. The “Cyberpunks” of today are probably being pirated somewhere in the even less developed world (this is also why gaming studios go online more and more, the potential player base is unimaginably massive), but just know: if you make good games, they will be your loyal paying players one day. 

China is no longer pirating games, but the gamers know when a good game is a good game. The mobile gamers of China, too, want the quality of games that we get to play. I think censoring is ok, and every country has its own censorship (even here in the West), but don’t forget, make a good game first. Make the Lich Kings, the Deckerd Cains of today first. 

If you are from China over the wall reading this, I want you to know: just be more confident in the culture, have some faith in its gaming community in the long term. Don’t boycott everything, the general public of the West don’t want China to be demolished all the time!

And if you are Tencent or NetEase, instead of bribing the officials in letting your shitty mobile version of everything through the Chinese internet, why not grow some balls. Put money in the long term gaming industry in the country, let the work do the talk. Sell the country and the culture through good games. 

I know all of this is a fantasy, but this is how I feel.",1571088707.0,gamerluke13,True,False,False,0.45,0,1385696

Hey Folks!,

i was really blown away by all the helpfull advise I got from all of you! It fealt really good to get it of my chest.

As Before:
english is not my native language
TL;DR will be at the bottom

On to the update:

As many of you suggested, i grew a pair of balls and told my current GF(22F) about what had happened. To be honest, I was scared shitless because of it but things turned out really well :).
We sat down and talked the entire night, not just about this but about pretty much everything about our respective past relationships and life events. I feel closer to her then ever and in fact I believe that I am very much in love with her.

Now the juicy part (and the part that made me think, that i truly have found the one):

For this Story to make sense here are some Infos about us:
I am 1,78m (5 foot 7 I believe) and my new GF M(22f) is only 1,54m...however she is a former athlete (fencing) and is in perfect shape...and sexy as all hell (don't want to brag but she has a beatifull figure)
My ex GF J(F22) is almost as tall as I am and much more ""chubby"" then M (she is not fat or anything but obviously visible less ""toned"" which was always an issue for her)

Now the real Story bit:

Last Saturday I decided to treat me and M to a fancy dinner in the best Restaurant in town (like Michelin star-Level best Restaurant, you dont want to know how much Money I spent on that evening but it was SO WORTH IT for many reasons)

The Restaurant itself is right next door to a really tasty non-chain fast-Food burger Joint which is also were the Story takes place. 
I had told M to Dress up as nice as she could and we were both looking our best (I had suited up and she wore a tight black Dress and heals that almost cut our evening short when I saw it the first time :DDD)
As we walk down the road towards the Restaurant I see Js new guy standing outside having a cigarette. As we have some time left for our reservation we join him and start talking. I introduce M to him and we have a casual chat. As it is really way to warm for mid february my GF opens up her Long coat and reveals the dress below and I get to see the Guys eyes bulge a bit (which i found highly amusing). As we finish up our cigarettes J leaves the burger Joint with a large bag of take out. She is in sweats and without Makeup (which makes her look like 5 years older then she actually is, much to my continued amusement). She stops dead when she sees me and my GF chatting with her BF. 
That is the part where things get really awesome (for me at least):

Me, wanting to be nice, introduce M and J, who is **visably** uncomfortable with all of this.
Thats when M says a sentence that made me allmost choke from laughter:
""So this is your Ex from *6* months ago? She is really pretty, even in *sweats*!""
As I don't have a fitting answer to that, I just nod but I can see that the remark hit home with the guy as his cogs visibly start turning in his head.
J is dead silent and has a REALLY angry scowl on her face and starts tugging at the guys arm to get going. 
As I see it, I just say: ""Well our table at [expensive Restaurant] should be ready by now, you guys have a **greaaaat** night."" and me and M turn around and leave.
We end up having an awesome evening at the restaurant and after that. I just casually ask her why she felt like saying that to their faces. She just looks at my surprised and asks ""Say what?"" and I explain the part with the 6 months vs 8 months again. She starts chuckeling and says, that she didn't even do it on purpose, which I believe as she is not really the vindictive kind of person (neither am I actually, despite of how it may sound. I am however a big fan of a little Thing called ""Schadenfreude"")

Fast Forward to yesterday evening (and the reason I felt like posting this update)

I get a FB message from the guy that goes like this:

Him: ""Hey man how was dinner with your girl? I allways wanted to go to [expensive Restaurant] but it is really hard to get a table there.""

Me: ""It was awesome, despite the Price tag. We got really lucky with our reservation because some People dropped out last Minute.""

Him: ""Thats lucky for you man! hey btw what did your girl mean when she said you and J broke up 6 months ago?""

Me: ""She didn't tell you? oO""

Him: ""No what do you mean?""

Me: ""J and I dated for allmost two years, and only broke it of a little bit over 6 months ago.""

Him: ""Okay""

After that he didn't reply anymore and tbh I didn't care enough to Keep pressing him for more.

I told M this morning and she thinks its a good Thing, that I told him.


**TL;DR**
Me and new GF ran into Ex and her new guy, got a little bit of unplanned payback and had an awesome evening.

I get it, people are unhappy about Dexit. Hell, I went through every single game generation last year and caught them all so I could have living dex, and I can't bring those across. But you also couldn't bring your Pokemon over until you'd beat the elite four in nearly every other game, or at least had to wait months for Pokemon Bank support - so your first playthrough would only include Pokemon in that region's Dex. Personally, I'm looking forward to it as it makes the competitive scene a lot more accessible for me.

People's concerns are valid, and they should be able to express them. But when every comment is ""\[this Pokemon\] died to we could have this feature"" etc. it's honestly exhausting. Can't we just let people enjoy things?",1573560915.0,resogunner,True,False,False,0.49,0,1991115

A few minor updates to our rules,0,d5qpwn,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d5qpwn/a_few_minor_updates_to_our_rules/,1,"Hello everyone! Got an update this time with some minor changes. 

**Personal Story rule**

We are lowering our personal story character count from 750 to 500. Meaning personal stories must have at least 500 characters, less than that will be removed. 

A while back we loosened this restriction from 1000 characters to 750, this is a follow up to that. One thing we noticed was that we were removing threads that were unique and gave a full description. 

**Call to Action rule**

We have changed the wording of the call to action rule from

>No calls to action - don't rile up the community to vote for/against something or to boycott/support a person/organization. This does not include polls or contests created FOR the subreddit.

to

>Attempting to rally the community to do a specific thing (vote for a poll, boycott something, support something, etc) is a call to action and will be removed. This does not include polls or contests created FOR the subreddit

The goal here was to provide some more clarity on what is covered by the rule. The intent remains the same, but we feel under this wording it comes across better. 

**Vote Manipulation Rule**

Another rewording here, going from 

>DO NOT:
> 
>* Ask for votes on your reddit submissions anywhere.
>* Brigade; this means ganging up on other users through voting and/or commenting on linked threads.
>* Tell others to upvote or downvote submissions or comments.
>* Share Reddit links with your friends either explicitly or implicitly asking them to upvote your content.
>* Ask or allude to giving your post ""attention"", say ""don't upvote this"", ""this will be downvoted"" or otherwise try to influence voting.

to

>[Cheating or attempting to manipulate voting](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-vote-cheating-or) may get your account banned from Reddit. Posts that have been found to be manipulated will be removed, and won't be reapproved. VM cannot be undone, you can only submit a new post.

>* Do not encourage friends/followers anywhere to upvote or downvote Reddit posts.

>* Do not brigade; this means ganging up on other users through voting and/or commenting on linked threads.

>* Do not ask for upvotes in the post, or say ""This will be downvoted, but..."".

The below section remains the same

>You can link or otherwise share your comments / links on social media, *[provided you follow the exact titling shown here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueOfMeta/comments/9b2j3r/we_are_changing_our_vote_manipulation_rule/)* Any other titling will be removed. This format is: “I just posted ‘POST TITLE’ on Reddit.” followed by a link to your post.

When making this change we wanted to add a bit of information without making it too bulky. A brief introduction was added to explain what VM is and the potential consequences. Additionally, we added reddit's rules on VM into our rules to provide more information.

This week at Bungie, a collision course was set.


With the launch of Season of the Worthy, Guardians are heading into the wild to discover lost Seraph Bunkers and power up Rasputin’s defenses to take on this new threat. Here is a quick look at some of what you can expect during the new Season of Destiny:


[Video Link](https://youtu.be/_w9yR_rBU0Y)


Before we embark on the first TWAB of the new Season, we’d like to acknowledge some feedback that we’ve been seeing in the wild. We had a large change to emblems and stat trackers, which we’ll be talking about later in the TWAB. We’re also seeing some discussion on the new weapons of the season, and lack of Ritual Weapons for Vanguard, Crucible, and Gambit. The team is currently reviewing and discussing the feedback, and we will be looking to talk about our goals for weapons in a future TWAB.


There are a variety of other topics, from Eververse to armor mods, which we’re collecting feedback on and discussing internally as a team. While we don’t have any specific changes to announce at this time, we wanted to make sure you know that we see the feedback and are actively discussing this internally. Once we have more information, we’ll be sure to let you know.


It’s been a wild launch week, but we’re just getting started. Tomorrow’s Friday and the day isn’t just reserved for Xûr anymore. Trials returns, and we’ve got a bit to talk about to get you prepared.

##Trials Returns

In case you still haven’t heard. Trials of Osiris returns this Season. The first weekend of action-packed high-stakes PvP starts tomorrow. Let’s set the mood, shall we?


[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gooi0jKJ7GY)


For everyone not familiar with Trials of Osiris, here’s a quick rundown of what to expect. The game mode is 3v3 Elimination, using the same rules showcased in the last few Seasons. The key difference is that Saint-14 will be calling the matches, and now your Power matters. You must be 960 Power to participate. Your Trials Passage, or “card” is your ticket in. Try to get as many wins as possible before you hit three losses and have to start over. Earn a flawless victory by winning seven matches with no losses. You can reset your Trials Passage at any time by accessing the item in your quests, or on the Trials of Osiris activity node. 


One change from the previous Trials of Osiris is that there are no Boons that you will need to purchase and apply. Instead, there will be five different Trials Passages you can choose from that offer different bonuses built in like forgiving one loss per run or granting bonus experience from wins that increase with the number of wins on a ticket. 


Players will also be able to earn Trials Tokens to turn into Saint-14 to increase their reputation and earn Trials Engrams. Any Tokens that a player doesn’t spend that week will be removed when Trials ends at the next weekly reset so spend them if you got them.


We have more details on these features and how Trials of Osiris will work in our full [Trials of Osiris help article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48745).


Trials of Osiris will match you with opponents based on your connections and how many wins you have logged on your current Passage. To submit yourselves to these Trials, [you must form your own Fireteam](https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2/FireteamSearch?platform=0&activityType=3&lang=&groupid=&). 


Now go and shine bright as beacons of light.

In preparation for Trials of Osiris, our security team has been hard at work protecting the integrity of the Crucible. We’re always working to improve our defenses against cheats and other malicious activity. Recently, we’ve improved our methods for combating those who feel like they don’t have to [play by the rules](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/11929). We will be keeping a close eye on Trials of Osiris, where the stakes are even higher. 


New server-side security features have been deployed specifically for Trials of Osiris, and we hardened our network layer to make it more resilient to network manipulation. We’ve also increased our staffing to be able to handle the review and banning of cheaters.


Because the ongoing battle with cheating is fought primarily with information, we can’t go into exact details on our methods which might tip off would-be cheaters on ways to get around them. We can assure you we take cheating seriously and will continue to work to both prevent it and punish any offenders. 


If you do come across anyone you suspect of cheating, please report them in-game as well as online with our [Suspected Cheater Report Form](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Troubleshoot?oid=13967).


Eyes up…

##Tracker Tracking

In Season of the Worthy, all emblems have been converted to use our new stat trackers. That means all emblems will be inspectable and can have trackers equipped or not. 


When designing this system, our overall goal is to provide players more ways and options to show off their accomplishments. Our first selection of stats were determined by prioritizing stats that represented a skill that could be improved week-over-week or Season-over-Season and be an accomplishment that players would want to display that was meaningful to other players. Because of that, some stats that couldn’t be completed or improved any longer weren’t included.


We believe in these requirements in principle, but strictly applying them retroactively unfairly removed your ability to show off accomplishments that you could flaunt in Seasons prior. It was a change made with good intention, but was the wrong way to roll out a new system. We’ve identified some stats that can be added back in a future patch, and wanted to share them with you. We are currently planning to add these stat trackers back in an update later in the Season. 


###Seasons



* Lifetime

   * Season 8 Season Pass Rank Earned
   * Season 9 Season Pass Rank Earned
   * Fractaline Donated

###Account



* Lifetime

   * Kills as a Sentinel Titan
   * Kills as a Striker Titan
   * Kills as a Sunbreaker Titan
   * Kills as a Flowwalker Hunter
   * Kills as a Nightstalker Hunter
   * Kills as a Gunslinger Hunter
   * Kills as a Stormcaller Warlock
   * Kills as a Dawnblade Warlock
   * Kills as a Voidwalker Warlock

###Crucible



* Lifetime

   * Gold Medals Earned
   * Longest Glory Win Streak
   * Total Valor Resets

###Destinations



* Lifetime

   * Pit of Heresy Solo Flawless Completions


This list isn't complete yet and we plan to add to it before the update is released. As a note, **none of the stats that were previously tracked have been lost**. We’re still storing them all. Some stats would take a bit more work to return to the fold, and we’d love to see more player feedback to help us prioritize which you’d like to see return in the future. Feel free to sound off on the Bungie.net forums, DTG Subreddit, or even Twitter. We’ve got eyes … everywhere.


**Which emblem stats did you find most valuable, and why?**


As always, thank you for the feedback surrounding this feature. We’re excited for players to mix and match different stats with different emblems, and are eager to improve the feature in future updates.

##Merci Beaucoup

This past week several players from the French community showed the kindness and generosity of Guardians by putting on a charity event. Here is our Community Manager **Epyon** with a quick recap of the event. 


>
>**Epyon**: This past weekend was a special time for the French community and I wanted to thank all the amazing people involved in the Unitystreamzz charity event and the whole French community. French content creators put on a 72-hour livestream marathon. Their goal was to help Camille, a daughter of one of the members of our community who contracted leukemia a few years ago. She’s on her way to recovering but the French community wanted to help her smile again. To say that they achieved their goal would be an understatement.


>
>During these 72 hours of livestreaming, more than 6,000 viewers watched some of their favorite Guardians taking up challenges set up by themselves or the community. Those viewers also donated a total of 10,724 euros (around 12,200 dollars).

Also, a special thanks to all the moderators, Teyzil, Donovan,Lou_Lou, ATrlfe, Stark, PFonsde, Louloutte, Wiphy, Didigatari, and Kinkinpower, who did tremendous work helping out with the contests and prize drawings. And double thumbs up to ZoulyZoo, who organized the event and led the way.

Here we go. One more sleep until Trials of Saint-14 … err, Osiris makes its long-awaited debut. Do you have your fireteam ready? You only have a few more hours to make ready. We’ll be watching as teams face off in hopes of earning a visit to the new Lighthouse.

[No Spoilers] The Wendy's one-shot is a funny idea but I sincerely hope this is the last time they do something like this.,44,dd43cj,criticalrole,https://www.reddit.com/r/criticalrole/comments/dd43cj/no_spoilers_the_wendys_oneshot_is_a_funny_idea/,262,"I've been a critter since 2016, and for the most part it's been great to watch the show grow. However, I think I've finally hit a point where I'm questioning it a bit. I love the cast to death, I know it's their company, and I've certainly consumed indie content sponsored by big companies before, but this felt off somehow. One of the things that makes Critical Role special is the lack of the influence of big brands. No matter how big they've gotten they've always managed to keep things ""in the family"", so to speak, keeping even sponsorships low-key and relevant to tabletop and creators. The larger brands that they've worked with like Dark Horse, Blizzard, and Nerdist have at least always been in the nerd-sphere. Even the animated series is 100% fan funded, which is fucking amazing considering the scale, and was a watershed moment for this type of independent creation. But now... Wendy's? Really? On the surface it's hilarious, but to me it kind of feels like a departure from the values that CR has previously espoused. Wendy's isn't exactly an ethical company, and while these days it's pretty much impossible to avoid working even indirectly with unethical mega-corps, it's possible to not promote them. They are managing to keep it sort of tongue in cheek but to me it still feels off.

I am absolutely not hating on the cast or their company, and I know that there may very well be a good reason for them to accept that sweet, sweet burger money. I don't know their position and whether or not I would do the same were I in a similar one. I can't tell them what to do or how to run their business, and I still support them. I just wanted to share my own personal feelings on this and discuss it civilly. Feel free to disagree!

Edit: Welp, I got added to r/controversialclub for this post. That kind of makes me sad, I honestly didn’t think this would blow up and I didn’t think that my passing thoughts would be this inflammatory, but I suppose it’s fair and maybe I should have expected it. I will say that my mind has been changed somewhat from a lot of the excellent arguments in this thread and while I never really thought it was a big deal, I’m no longer concerned. I never meant to come off as gatekeepy and I certainly never thought that CR has “sold out”. At the end of the day I guess this is just growing pains for the company. I think it’s possible to be wistful and nostalgic for the “simpler times” while also feeling happy and grateful for the growth, and I think it’s okay to respectfully share those feelings. I love Critical Role and the cast and that’s never going to change, no matter how many fast food themed one shots they put out.

Yasuo Rework Idea,255,fx2max,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fx2max/yasuo_rework_idea/,87,"Ok guys I've had this idea since I was a fetus about how we can rework yasuo 

I know you guys love hearing about rework discussions so here it is

Q - (bronze tempest)stays the same but your q does more/less damage the higher/lower rank you are.

For example bronze -10 at all rank 
Silver -5
Gold 0
Platinum +5
Diamond +10

This change allows the idiots to stop crying about yasuo on the lol boards and allow him to go through ban phase

W - (master of the wind)wind wall will be removed and replaced with your mastery button. 

This one was tough but my intent was to provide the player with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking their mastery level and allowing easy accessibility to the mastery key.

If you do not have a mastery level on yasuo this will automatically type lol ez in all chat 

E - Wheeping Blade

This ability will act the same as it does now but will leave a blue trail of tears for 2 seconds after your last dash. the damage on this ability scales up based on the amount of times your teammates have told you to stop feeding 
While you were trying your best 

R - toxic breath 

This ability will be changed to a one time use extremely situational ability which allows you to type anything you wish to your team or the other team without a fear of getting banned for 30 seconds.


Synergies in the kit - start the game by using your w (mastery spam) this will make your team  think you are good which is what you want. Play how you normally would and feed your lane till about 0/3.  You should be around lvl 6 and this is where you want to start an argument with your team and bait them into feeding your e. Normally your team will call you a typical yasuo main and they will call you a feederNow this is where your e becomes very good, you will be able to 1v5,  and carry yourself higher to up your q damage.",1586334025.0,masterfingerbangers,True,False,False,0.55,255,4088601

Thought Game: How to get to Grey,0,eby3sm,HelloInternet,https://www.reddit.com/r/HelloInternet/comments/eby3sm/thought_game_how_to_get_to_grey/,141,"Aright, here’s a little thought experiment game I’ve been playing in my head for a few months I thought I’d share with the Tims at large. 

You board a plane, sit down and realize you are sitting next to CGP Grey on a 3 hour flight. You are excited to talk with him. Maybe you’ve even had a few things bouncing in your head you’ve always wanted to run by him. 

BUT you KNOW if Grey discovers a) a Tim just sat next to him on a plane, and b) he’s just been recognized - and c) you’re looking to chat...  you have suddenly built for him a personalized Hell that he will not only feel tortured through, but will inevitably get on the mic on the next episode of HI and exclaim how terrible the experience was. 

***Here’s the game: devise a way to approach Grey. For every minute you can spend talking to Grey you get a point. For every minute he is unhappy talking to you, you lose a point. Find a way to get the most points aka how do you talk to Gray on a plane as a Tim who has recognized him and have him ENJOY the experience?***

Things I’ve considered: 
- trying to strike up a natural convo about subjects I wanna discuss without ever telling him I’m a Tim and that I recognize him. 

- passing a note explaining the situation without saying a word and offering him the option to acknowledge you and discuss things or just... not. 

What can the Tims come up with for this? How would you get to Grey?

Edit: Wow. I’ve never been called a creep by so many people. I am genuinely sorry I posted this. I had sincerely thought we were trying to take a situation that would be Grey’s nightmare and trying to figure out how to make it a positive experience for him. But when this many people say you’re wrong, it’s usually you. So I’m sorry. And to you Grey, specifically... it never occurred to me the post *itself* might cause issues for you. I’m sorry to you most of all. I’d delete it but it’s been tweeted and retweeted, even copy/pasted below.

"Valve, you have lost 3 million unique players in last 6 months, at what point do you start givng a fuck about your most profitable game?",303,dtjtr0,DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/dtjtr0/valve_you_have_lost_3_million_unique_players_in/,614,"We are currently sitting at a measly number of 350k daily players, do you understand how low that actually is? To make it worse, League of Legends recently revealed their daily player base, as part of 10 year anniversary of LoL, their daily active player base seems to be 8 million. They are also the most watched game on twitch (yea guys, moba genre is not dead, dota is).

Gaben alone has networth of 4 billion dollars and there are only 300 people employed in his company, probably less than 10 people of those 300 are working on dota. Why doesnt Valve invest more into Dota and employ more people? People who would work in marketing, people who would work on new player experience, people who would work around Dota content in general, and finally a community manager?

People on this sub act as its impossible to bring new players in the game, saying moba genre is dead, saying dota 2 is too hard for new players when actually LoL is harder for new players to start since their game has much more things new players will have to worry about (2 additional spells for each hero, jungle creeps giving buffs, not a single hero has passive ability, runes and masteries and so on). People think marketing and advertising wouldnt work. As a guy who is currently studying marketing, I can assure you that with proper marketing and good product (which dota certainly is) you will be able to achieve your goals (in dota's case increasing the player base).

It seems to me that Valve has somehow given up on Dota, that they only want to reduce the number of players leaving and squeeze as much money from players until the game ''dies'' in a couple of years. This game is by far the best game I have ever played and I still hold the opinion that it can have A LOT more players than it currently has.


**I would greatly appreciate if you guys could read the post and state your opinion on this, rather than just blatantly downvoting and leaving the thread.**

This Week at Bungie, the path was found.


The Corridors of Time have been charted. Guardians from around the world took on the monumental challenge of navigating time itself, some losing their minds in the progress. We’d never shipped a puzzle of this size before, and watching the community engagement was a thrill in itself. We’ve seen a few requests for commentary on the creation and development of this puzzle. As always, we’re happy to invite you behind the scenes and share some of the thinking that goes into the experiences you play.


>
>**Destiny Dev Team:** Over the past week, we’ve watched in awe as the community came together to solve one of Destiny’s most complex puzzles to date. Everyone who took the time to participate in the solution will be remembered for years to come – whether you submitted a screenshot, transcribed puzzle pieces, generated maps, wrote code, worked the data, or cat-wrangled this monumental team effort. Please take a moment to congratulate yourselves. Your efforts and accomplishments were truly inspiring. Watching the first players solve the puzzle in the early hours of Monday morning was a career highlight for many of us on the Development Team.
>
>
>
>
>
>With the puzzle solved and the Corridors of Time closing next week, we wanted to take a moment to talk about our goals and early designs for this puzzle.
>
>
>
>
>
>When we started planning the puzzle, we created a few goals to guide our development:


* Create a time maze through which any player can dive to discover secrets and lore
* Serve as a shared community puzzle that rewards the Exotic Fusion Rifle
* Celebrate community achievement and invite all players to partake in the reward


>
>
>
>
>
>With these goals in mind, we took inspiration from multiple sources in creating the early designs for the puzzle.
>
>
>
>
>
>The bones originated several years ago with the discovery of the Sleeper Simulant and the ensuing quest to unlock it. At the time, we recognized that the moment of discovery was reserved for the few people that happened to be online at the time when that hidden content unlocked. Similarly, the secret missions for The Whisper and Zero Hour were also moments of discovery reserved for the few people online within a limited time window to experience first. By contrast, this puzzle was meant to be experienced by everybody who wanted to be included.
>
>
>
>
>
>As is tradition at Bungie during our annual studio Pentathlon (which was held last Friday), many of us spend the entire day solving puzzles crafted by some of our brightest minds. This always culminates in a meta-puzzle that cannot be solved without the contribution of all of the smaller solutions. Similarly, the Corridors of Time puzzle was designed from the start to be very simple in nature, but also require require that all of the little bits come together in harmony before revealing its solution.
>
>
>
>
>
>The delivery of this puzzle came together as the team began exploring the concept and narrative for Season of Dawn. The puzzle seemed to fit well with the idea of the Corridors of Time, with players meandering and weaving through time to find a very specific reality. The early ideas for this space were roughly based on the idea of the cult-classic movie *Cube*, where you would leave one door and end up in another identical room with a new death trap waiting for you. As always, our artists delivered a mind-bending and stunning visual language that simply brought the whole experience together into something that inspires the imagination. Much like other classic movies, such as Alice in Wonderland or the Matrix, this space and the way it was connected together was done so to invoke questions like “Just how deep does this rabbit hole go? Can you just keep going on forever?"", and ""Is there even an end to this?”
>
>
>
>
>
>Again, we want to thank everyone who participated in this puzzle or cheered from the sidelines. We’re actively monitoring and collecting your feedback, from the puzzle itself to the rewards contained, to inform how we build experiences like this again in the future. 


Now, we look ahead. We’ve got a rundown of performance issues that are currently under investigation, and another patch note preview for next week's update!


***



##Performance Pass


Over the last few months, we’ve been gathering feedback associated with game performance. This translates to moments when you may see framerate drops during activities or long load times when accessing a menu. The team has been deep in the code, looking for potential causes of these issues. 


Next week, we’ll have a few performance issues addressed in Destiny 2 Update 2.7.1, including:


* Improved some performance issues in the Chamber of Suffering encounter.
* Fixed an issue where players could die when transitioning from the Necropolis encounter to the Tunnels of Despair.
* Improved a performance issue that could occur when chunks of land return, or are removed during the Sanctified Mind encounter.
* Improved performance when receiving certain investment related messages. This could be reward acquisition, placing tributes, or interacting with Obelisks.


   * The largest impact will be in the Tower, but this should help everywhere.
* Players who load into Crucible matches faster than their peers will no longer be put in black screen. Rather, they will remain in spaceflight until all players have loaded into the match, as before.


Some proposed fixes are currently in development for the below items. These need to pass through rigorous testing before they’ll find their way to a future edition of patch notes: 


* UI stuttering and framerate drops when loading or applying mods
* Framerate issues in Gambit and Gambit Prime
* Framerate issues during the Sanctified Mind encounter of the Garden of Salvation Raid
* Framerate issues in the Pit of Heresy Dungeon, specifically in tunnel encounters
* General improvements to performance on PC when a lot of debris is on the ground


While our goal is to address these at the beginning of the next season, these fixes may be delayed if further issues arise. We’ll be sure to keep you updated as we approach Season of [Redacted]. There are also other performance issues we're currently investigating that aren't listed above. If you've been encountering framerate drops or stuttering issues during gameplay, please make sure to post a report to the [#Help forum on Bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help). Please include which platform you were playing on, what activity you were in, and a video if possible.

##Patch Note Preview, v2

Last week, we had a short and sweet preview of what’s coming in Destiny 2 Update 2.7.1. While Hard Light is creating some excitement, we have a few more patch notes addressing Quests, Seals, Exotic perks, and more.


**Investment**



* Fixed an issue that is preventing Eris from granting her final Lore entry
* Fixed an issue where the “Green with Envy” Quest was not progressing for some players
* Fixed an issue where the “Playin’ the Odds” emblem was not unlocking correctly for players


   * This could prevent some players from fully unlocking the Dredgen title
* Improved Black Armory Rare Bounty acquisition


   * Chances increase as you complete weekly and daily bounties
   * Guaranteed to drop from bounty completion after 5 days if completing all Ada-1 bounties



**Sandbox**



* Fixed an issue where the Heavy Handed mod could trigger from Telesto bolts
* Fixed an issue where players could retain buffs from Wormgod Caress, Winter’s Guile, and Synthoceps even after swapping armor

   * Equip restrictions on Wormgod Caress and Winter’s Guile will be lifted once this patch has shipped


We’ll have a few more notes to share; expect the full list on Tuesday when Update 2.7.1 becomes available.

That’s a wrap for this week. As we near the end of the season, we’ve got a few final stops on the roadmap. Next week, Cozmo will bring some details concerning the Empyrian Foundation, which is just under two weeks away.


We’ll see you again soon.

Now, they have released the investigative report, 4 years in coming, from the OPM hack that was so devastating to our nation and those working both overt and covert operations to keep our nation safe.

In this article on cyberscoop posted this morning:[Senate investigation finds agencies 'unprepared' to protect Americans' data](https://www.cyberscoop.com/senate-investigation-data-protection-opm-breach/)

>Federal agencies are “failing to implement basic cybersecurity standards” needed to protect Americans’ personal data and keep the nation’s secrets safe from hackers, a Senate investigation has concluded. The report, which drew on 10 years’ worth of inspector general reports at eight agencies, paints a picture of persistent neglect of standard network defense measures.

>It comes more than four years after the breach of the Office of Personnel Management, in which alleged Chinese hackers stole sensitive personal data on 22 million current and former federal employees. Lessons from that sweeping compromise of American security clearances still haven’t been heeded, according to the report from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs’ Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.

>“Despite major data breaches like OPM, the federal government remains unprepared to confront the dynamic cyberthreats of today,” laments the report, which covered the departments of Agriculture, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, State and Transportation, as well as the Social Security Administration. In addition to DHS, the Senate subcommittee chose to review the seven agencies that the Office of Management rated the poorest on cybersecurity.

>“The federal government can, and must, do a better job of shoring up our defenses against the rising cybersecurity threats,” said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who chairs the subcommittee.

In some mildish defense of the dex cut. From the views of a 3d modeler.,117,dtuzfd,NintendoSwitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/dtuzfd/in_some_mildish_defense_of_the_dex_cut_from_the/,441,"So. As we all know. Pokemon sword and shield is coming and right now the big hot topic is the cut dex. Truthfully, last time i saw these kinds of flames was when fallout 76 opened its doors.  However. Bethesda is a whole other topic (port fallout 3 or 4 already, damnit) 

But back on the topic of S&S. I do smell some bad management that led to the cut dex. But i also feel that this may of been a long time coming. Sneezing the question into google of “how many pokemon are there” brings up 829 pokemon. 

If we were still in the days of sprites. This Wouldn’t be too bad. As drawing them out on paper, color and porting to the game wouldnt be to bad. Thats why so many indie games are 2d. Its extremely easy to work with. 

In the realm of 3d however. Things arent so kind. All the sudden you have to worry about how it actually would be. What its side are like. Its shape, etc, etc. this usually goes through a process like this, per model 

-concept art
-color
-modeling
-rigging
-weight painting
-uv unwrapping
-texturing
-engine implementation
-bug fixing  

 That doesnt sound too bad, right? Well. Think again. Now. I’m gonna stop here because i can already hear the keyboard warriors typing “they’re just porting the 3DS models!!!!!” 
I hear people saying this all the time. But does no one seem to realize the asiening process of porting things? 

Not a lot of people realize what exactly goes on under the hood of porting. You have to use multitude of softwares, engines, and tools. And even then. Sometimes shit just doesn’t work. 

Most companies and studios design their models in a external engine thats made for modeling, like blender or 3ds max, then ported to what ever engine they’re using for the game. Which sounds simple enough but it can be flat out development hell.  

Let me explain why. Though engines have gotten friendlier over the years. They can still be a royal pain in the ass to work with. As not everything is plug and play. So, having everything come over smoothly. Is not guaranteed, Especially if the porting tools are made in house. You have to hope, that when moving stuff engine to engine that 

-the model stays intact
-the rig is still there 
-its uv map is still there
-the texture is still there

And this isnt even guaranteed. As you may have some models that work. And others dont. And if you have a computer crash transferring the model. And if no backups were made. That model might be toast. Left to be built from the ground up. And sometimes it takes less time to freshly rebuild things if the tools just arent working. 

Now. Back to what i was talking about and to merge porting with my original point. “All this doesnt sound that bad” you say “game freak has a team of 200 people. This should take no time at all!” Well. Out of those 200 people. Not all of them are modelers, or programmers. You may have a handful of 20 programmers, and 20 modelers, and even then thats a bit generous, as teams are split up usually. 

Now. Even with this team of maybe 10 modelers working on a pokemon each. And somehow a port comes over just fine. Heres the big catch. Porting is not a done deal. Even if they are using the hi poly model and the improved textures from lets go and pokemon go. Theres still a few gaping holes. The rig and weight panting, which relates to the model. 

Starting with a note on textures. Even if they are using the improved textures. There is still a very, very good chance that they had to be updated. Which takes even more time that a texture artist has to deal with. But we’re looking at a best case scenario.  

Have you ever wondered why some animations seemed so stiff, and very limited? Well. I’m gonna explain why and how it relates to the model.  

 You see, in the 3d realm. Animations work based on a rig. A rig is pretty much a skeleton of a model. The more advanced a rig is, the more flexible it can be and the more advanced things it can do. However. A rig by itself, has no way to interact with with a mesh unless it is parented (ie, joined to) and how this parenting works with rigs. Is that you pair it. And assign weights to the mesh for each bone. Say a scale from blue to red. Blue being the bone doesnt effect that mesh area at all to red being it fully effects it.  This is to make sure when you bend the arm of a rig, say at the elbow, it doesnt cause the knee of the mesh to stretch out with it.

What does this mean for the current models and stiff animation? Well. Weight painting tends to work on a face-by-face basis. As the more faces you have, the higher poly it is, the better and more natural looking the mesh will look when animated. Now, the 3ds though great. Was not a powerful machine. And certain companies can use limited hardware better then others. When these  new pokemon were being developed. It is very likely that these models were made with the 3ds limited specifications in mind. Thus, corners were cut and the only what was necessary  to keep things looking nice, were left and what wasnt, was cut. This was fine for the handhelds, as having a more, lesser experience was normal compared to the main consoles. 

This is fine. However. There is a huge issue with this. With these cut models, the rigs are cut down as well as it just makes things easier, saves space and memory. However. When you bring these models made for a cut down experience over to a console, where that full experience is now completely expected is when the issues start to pile up. 

With a limited rig, you can do a lot, a lot more then you think, however, sometimes it isn’t enough. And changes have to be made. To do this, the rig *and* model have to be changed. Increasing poly counts, and depending on the program. Adjusting the rig, *completely* thrashes all the weight panting, and sometimes, the entire rig might even have to be redone, which means *animations* have to be redone and oh dear. The model was adjusted, which means that now that old uv unwrap, might be broken now, so that has to be fixed and with it, that old texture has a chance of not fitting and working right! As theres now all the sudden this new mesh that wasn’t there before and now it is here.

And to top it all off, a lot of these models likely have to be cleared off by someone or checked! And if that person doesn’t like it, they have to go back and fix it! And thats not even factoring in the occasional computer crash, corruption, and the other things the modelers have to work on and finally, most importantly of all!!!!!!

MONEY!!!!!!

I’m sure a lot of devs at game freak likely wanted to make a full dex but a lot of things at offices have a chain of command. And a lot of these things i mentioned are done with corners cut to made money or did what they could with what ever they had. Ie, the bare necessaries to get the game out on holiday season to maximize profit with the nintendo switch lite especially. Which sucks! But, companies are companies

And finally. To break it down.. to say 10 modelers. 5 are likely working on assets, map pieces, and other characters and what not in the game. This leaves 5 for Pokémon, say they get one model fully functioning and working, 1 per 1 days, so 14 a week. Still comes out to 332 days. Just shy of a year. And thats factoring in if they went to work every day, on a non stop crunch, with no holidays or stopping. Its hard work, its not cheap. 

And truthfully. I kind of feel sorry for my modeling brethren. 

In the end i’m absolutely sure money won over and thats why we’re getting what we are getting.",1573300167.0,matthewv1998,True,False,False,0.54,117,1991118

What an interesting morning,0,cb0jrg,orangetheory,https://www.reddit.com/r/orangetheory/comments/cb0jrg/what_an_interesting_morning/,44,"FYI to the people who get mad at everything:

f u :)

No need to explain myself to the OTF police 🚔🚨 #keepburning

My alarm went off at 5am, and I snoozed it until I peeked at my phone one last time at 6:03am. As I laid comfortably with my eyes gracefully shut in bed at 6:03, I quickly realized that I have a class at 6:15. My eyes bounced open and I ran out the door practicing what my 6 speeding tickets this year taught me— don’t hit anyone.

I get to class just as everyone is giving high fives. I start wondering why everything looks so blurry. I find out that I forgot to put my contacts on, which makes me happy because I actually didn’t hit anyone on the way to the studio. I make it through the rowing block (barely). I struggle to find my station in the weight floor because I’m so blind, but a friendly face grabs me and walks me to my station only for me to catch a glimpse of myself at the weight floor mirror. 

Bed head. Backwards shorts. Mis-matched shoes. It was a mess, but I embraced it. I work through the weight floor. I actually had shoulder pain, so I used options for a few of the exercises.

Finally... the treads. Each push feels like I’m on a sinking boat. I cannot keep my balance at high speeds presumably because of my blurred vision. I still make it through.

The best part... clapping at the end of class not only for myself showing up, but for everyone else who came to sweat.

"This game is literally a joke, change my mind.",279,d82w61,modernwarfare,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/d82w61/this_game_is_literally_a_joke_change_my_mind/,764,"16 years this franchise has been pumping out disc scan after disc scan and here's a list of stupid shit that has plagued the game since I started playing in MW2. And how to fix them

Format: 

- Problem

 - Solution
- Spawning right in front of or around the corner from enemy players and dying either instantly or as soon as you move.
 
 - Literally one line of code: if enemy.player < 10m away CHOOSE ANOTHER SPAWN POINT | Alternatively give us the option to spawn on teammates or choose our spawn point like in groundwar, therefore we don't spawn on anyone actively in combat or near any action, if we don't want to. 

- Player movement latency(shooting someone and in the killcam they strafed away from the bullet)

 - Stop being cheap bastards and run better servers

- Shotguns not killing someone with a chest shot at sufficient range

 - How about, if more than 40 percent of the spread hit a pellet in the enemys chest, he's dead because no one is moving with a fucking collapsed lung.

- Footsteps, why the fuck can I hear my own footsteps like a marching band in my ear both when I'm alive and in the enemy killcams. Yet people on the other team walking around the fucking corner for me sound like they have Ninja Pro?! get it? CAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE SOUNDS! or maybe they do! And I just can't hear them because my guy sounds like he's slapping his boots on the floor and every time we cap or lose a point in domination I get earraped even though there's permanent in game markers that tell me what team owns what point.

 - Give the option to disable ""minuscule"" sound cues, make a noise profile where footsteps are the loudest sound aside from gets right above you. Or, and this is a CRAZY idea: make the raw footstep file louder? WHOA

- Recoil RNG. It's 2019 and the guns still randomly jump around like a jack rabbit on crack making recoil control finesse nigh impossible unless you're playing on controller in which there's literally an auto-aim profile that leads the reticle in front of running players FOR YOU

 - Take 1 day on your schedule and draw a recoil pattern for each gun, code it into the game. Holy shit look at that, now people actually ~~have to~~ **can** try to aim instead of just spraying and praying. 

- The map design literally favors people picking spots to sit at and watch certain areas of the map. ESPECIALLY in game modes that have objectives. Once a team has any objective, pushing it becomes difficult as there is only one to two places to enter from a given direction, and yet 7 places in a 360 radius that could have an angle on that spot. Making it extremely risky to run out in the open and actually play the game in its ""fast paced"" advertised fashion.

 - Stop designing the maps like an office full of weekend airsoft players.

- Nameplate placement is super bugged right now. Usually people will be prone on the side of kind of box shaped cover. When you aim above the box (expecting someone to be head peeking there) you see the enemies name plate above the cover instead of in front of the cover and over their head. Have died countless times because I saw a name and started shooting even though they weren't even in my reticle.

 - How did this even get fucked up when you literally copy and paste the basics for every game when you start the next one? What did you think you could start from scratch after all this time of being the least innovative game devs of the decade and do it right?

Two bugs with new features just for shits and giggles

- Sniper glares can be seen through walls if any pixel of the players body is peeking past a corner or edge. How did EA get this one right and you guys can't?

 - Tell the game to process it's logic correctly

- Volumetric lighting & ray tracing. these fancy lighting features have been plauging FPS games since R6. Nobody wants to not be able to see into a doorway until their literally IN IT solely because you want the games sky to look pretty. Countless times I've died because people are headglitching with the sun behind them and all I see is the stupid light rays that these fucks think ""looks cool"" when I'm trying to shoot people as intended. 

 - Remove it. Nobody fucking cares how realistic the lighting is if they can't fucking see the people their supposed to shoot. It's not a fair fight if I can't fucking see the guy shooting at me because he's in a doorway and I'm outside. 

This game is a joke. Catered for 12 year olds with controllers to hold a button and let the game aim for them, all the while they hold angles and stare at the same spots from the same 3 places all. fucking. game. How dare the people that makes this iPhone of a video game claim this garbage is an ""esports"" game.",1569221508.0,worros,True,False,False,0.56,279,763873

Gypsy/Traveller culture explained by an educated English Traveller.,88,fb35i8,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/fb35i8/gypsytraveller_culture_explained_by_an_educated/,866,"I’m a young and educated English Traveller who lives well within the community. My mum and dad decided to send me and my little brother to school to do GSCE’s and then to college after realising that us being educated and learning skilled trades is a good way to make money, and after wishing they sent my older brothers to school.

I’m pretty typical for a 17 year old Traveller, I only have friends inside the community, enjoy hobbies that most Travelling boys my age enjoy, believe strongly In Christianity, speak Angloromani, go to all the Traveller events, etc. What makes me different though is the fact that I’m in the minority of Travellers who have gotten through education and I’m fairly intelligent and understand the issues inside the community.

I’m here today to try and educate some of you about the Travellers that live in Britain and Ireland. For those wondering I don’t talk how I type, and I do follow every traditions, belief and value below, apart from the part where I talk about the issues in the community.

Types of Travellers:
There are 6 main kinds of Travellers found in Britain and Ireland: 

[Romanichal Travellers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanichal) (English Romany Travellers).

[Irish Travellers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Travellers)

[Showman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showman#United_Kingdom) (Funfair Travellers).

[Welsh Kale Travellers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kale_(Welsh_Roma)) (Welsh Romany Travellers)

[Scottish Lowland Romany Travellers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gypsy_and_Traveller_groups#Lowland_Scottish_Gypsies/Travellers)

[Scottish Highland Travellers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gypsy_and_Traveller_groups#Indigenous_Highland_Travellers)

Romanichal Travellers, Welsh Kale and Scottish Lowland Travellers and Irish Travellers are recognised ethnic minority groups in Britain and are represented in the British Census (White Gypsy or Irish Traveller) and Irish Travellers are a recognised ethnic group in Ireland and are in the Irish Census. Gypsy was the name English people gave to Romany Travellers centuries ago, as they mistakenly believed we were Egyptian. Officially, Gypsy refers to Romany exclusively, although most non-Travellers call all Travelling people “Gypsies”. Most Romany Travellers (Myself included) identify with the term Traveller more than Gypsy, although we use it when speaking to non-Travellers more than we use the word Traveller. It’s common for different types of to be friends and for different types of Travellers to marry each other, at least in Britain where many different types of Travellers live.

Christian Ceremonies & Traditions:
Travellers are Christian people, we don’t go to church every Sunday, but attend churches multiple times a year for ceremonies like weddings, funerals and christenings. Most Christian ceremonies include going to the pub afterwards.
Travellers also “take oaths”, most oaths are taken on god but many are also taken on a family members life (usually their mother, a grandparent) or on a family members grave.
There are also “Gypsy Life and Light” missions which are basically Traveller churches under tents which move around the country.

Events and Socialising:
Travellers attend many horse races and fairs, which allows Travelling men to meet up (usually the men meet in pubs), Travelling women to meet up (they usually stay with their younger children during the events), and young Travellers to socialise at the events. 
The big fairs and horse races in England include Appleby-Horse fair, Cambridge midsummer fair, Royal Ascot horse race, Epsom Derby horse race, and Epsom fair. The Epsom derby and Epsom fair happen at the same time.
Travellers also have pay-parties for teenagers. A Travelling teenager will hire out somewhere with a bar to host a party, then will charge a price at the door (typically £20) and usually loads go. This allows the host to make a small profit and allows a party for young Travellers to socialise.
Many young Travellers go to pay-parties same for New Years, Easter, Halloween, etc, although many happen on random days throughout the year.
Young Travellers usually meet up in a town once a week, usually every Sunday, in a town, where they go for food, shisha bars, to drive around and generally just to socialise with other young Travellers.
Travelling men also often meet up with the men in the local community, and Travelling women also often meet up with the women in the local community.

Family Values:
Travellers usually have big families and keep close contact with extended family members.
Travellers believe that they should take care of elderly family members, rather than them living off pensions (which most don’t get) or in care homes.
Travellers often know most of their 2nd and 3rd cousins, many have close ties to family members further out.
There are close bonds between family members, including between older and younger family members and distant relatives. 

Superstitions:
Travellers believe in good luck and bad luck, and believe that certain things bring either good or bad luck.
For example, having a baby and getting a puppy at the same time brings bad luck in English Traveller culture, and spitting on your hands and rubbing them together brings good luck in English Traveller culture. There are several different Traveller superstitions which vary between each region and each group.

Conservative Values:
Most Travellers are very conservative, and disagree with things like homosexuality, abortion, sex outside/before marriage or divorce. This often ties in with Christian beliefs.
Most Travellers have gender roles in their families. The men go to work and earn the money, and the women cook meals, clean the home and take care of the children. It’s tradition that women always cook a hot meal for dinner everyday, and that they keep the home spotless and tidy.

Jobs:
Travelling men tend to be self-employed, and prefer working for themselves over working for a company or a non-Traveller. Most Travellers work as tradesman (Roofing, landscaping, fencing, building, paving, tarmacing, etc). Many also are dog breeders, horse breeders, caravan dealers, car dealers and scrap metal dealers. The richest of all Travellers are the ones who own sites. Many own camps which other Travellers permanently live on, and many own holiday parks which non-Travellers go to, and they earn a load of money from it. Nowadays many of us young Travelling boys are going to college and learning more skilled trades and are becoming electricians, plumbers and gas engineers.

Fighting:
Boxing is an extremely popular sport amongst Travellers, with many young Travelling boys attending boxing gyms up until their teen years, many become pro and have become some of the worlds best boxers.
It’s a Traveller custom that if two Travelling men have a dislike of each other, they have a fair bareknuckle fight, and no matter the outcome, they shake hands at the end and agree that the dispute is settled.
Because of fighting customs and a love for boxing, many Travellers are expert fighters.

Common Hobbies and Activities of Travellers:
Young Travellers often enjoy doing things like shooting (usually animals like pheasants, and rabbits), coursing (hunting with dogs), horse riding, quad biking, lamping, and boxing (both at gyms and supporting Traveller boxers).

Traveller Society and Self-Segregation:
Only 40% of Travellers in the UK live in mobile homes, nearly all that do live in permanent authorised sites, but a small minority still travel around full-time. The other 60% live in brick houses, nearly all that do live in houses close-by to a permanent site where they have family members living.
Travellers usually live in close-knit and insular communities, and Travellers tend to only socialise and marry Travellers, preferring friendships and marriages within the community. This has aloud Traveller culture to live on over the centuries and not die out.

Language and Heritage:
English Romany Travellers have Romany heritage and speak Angloromani, a mix of English and Romany.
Irish Travellers have Irish heritage but have been split of from the Settled Irish For centuries, they speak Shelta, a language which similar syntax and grammar to Hiberno-English.
Scottish Lowland Romany Travellers and Welsh Romany Travellers have Romany heritage and their own dialects of Romany. The Welsh Romany dialect is a mix of Romany, Welsh and English and the Scottish Romany Dialect is a mix of Romany and Scots.
Scottish Highland Travellers have native Gaelic/Highland heritage, and have their own dialect, Beurla-Reagaird.
Travelling Showman have British heritage and speak a variety of Polari.

History:
Irish Travellers and Scottish Highland Travellers split off from their settled communities centuries ago, and British Showman have been a self-segregated community which favour marriage within the community for generations as well, usually well over a century or two.
British Romany Travellers (English Travellers, Welsh Travellers and Lowland Scottish Travellers) have Romany heritage form the 16th century. 
Historically, Travellers would travel from village to village, and would make money as tinsmiths, hawkers, besom-makers, Christmas wreath-makers, basket-weavers, etc. Also many English Travellers used to help farmers during hop-picking season, in exchange for stopping on their farms and earning a bit of money. Industrialisation ended these traditional jobs though. It’s believed that the reason Cockney people know so many English Traveller words (like cushty, chore, mush, etc) is because during WW2, lots of London factory workers where out of work when their factories got bombed in the blitz, so many started commuting to farms in nearby Kent and started doing farm work for money, where they picked up lots of words form English Travellers also working there.
English Travellers bred the Gypsy Cob horse breed into existence, and invented the Vardo (Traditional Romany Traveller Wagons).
Historically, Travellers have faced a lot of persecution and laws against them over the centuries. English Travellers have historically been killed, deported and sent to the Americas as slaves, just for being Travellers. There is even documentation of freed Black people owning English Travellers as slaves in the US and Caribbean.

Issues:
Travellers face a lot of issues. Education is a big one, most Travellers pull their children out of school at a young age. This is because school is seemed unnecessary when girls aren’t going into work and when boys are doing the same jobs as their dads. Girls are usually pulled out when secondary school ends and most boys usually get pulled out about year 8/9. After being pulled out of school, girls stay at home with their mothers through the week and help clean, cook and take care of younger relatives and boys go to work with their father, or sometimes with an older brother or a grandfather to pick up their trade. Girls are still dripping out young, but there’s a fairly big minority of us finishing our GCSE’s and going to college to learn skilled trades. I think within a generation or two, most Travellers will be finishing their GCSE’s, and most Travelling boys will be doing college courses for trades. Criminality inside the community is also a big problem, although the majority of Travellers are not criminals, that said a large minority are, and Travellers make up 1 in 20 of prison inmates and 3 in 25 of secure training centre (which are essentially prisons for 12-18 year olds) inmates in England. Trespassing and unauthorised sites are also an issue, but only an extremely small minority trespass and live in unauthorised sites, as I mentioned before the majority of Travellers live in brick houses, and nearly all Travellers who live in mobile homes live in on permanent sites and have done for decades.
Travellers also face lots of discrimination in the UK, and one of the most hated, if not the most hated group in the UK. I think this is because people don’t accept what they don’t understand.

In the past, this is not something we've needed to address and so there was not a specific rule for it. Over the past 2-3 weeks we've moderated multiple posts of this nature and cited rule #1, ""All posts must be related to the Total War series. I feel that while this is somewhat true, the logic is tenuous and in need of a more concrete solution. 

To that end this rule has been added:

"We got laughed off Shark Tank for a notebook you microwave, and now we have the best-selling notebook on Amazon.

We're excited to answer your questions about Shark Tank, startup culture, crowdfunding, and what life is like in 2058.

Some proof: https://imgur.com/GkXIEyz
More proof: https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2019/08/29/nearly-five-years-on-rocketbook-is-still-blasting.html

In 2017, we appeared on Shark Tank to pitch a microwavable notebook and got laughed off the show by Mark Cuban without receiving an offer from any of the sharks. Using that pain to fuel our motivation, we built a new notebook: the Rocketbook Everlast. Easily erased with water and a cloth, the Everlast became the most crowdfunded office product on Kickstarter. It's also the best selling notebook on Amazon. Most importantly, we've since forgiven Mark Cuban for his lapse in judgment.

We've since launched 5 crowdfunding campaigns, including our most recent campaign for a futuristic legal pad: [The Rocketbook Orbit](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rocketbook/orbit-legal-pad?ref=ds3nfy&utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=Orbit_KS&utm_content=AMA)!

* Can't even patch or do maintenance properly
* Content is intended to be quick, cheap and shallow.
* Poor continuity of lore and storytelling. So many stories lacking closure
* No depth or secrets to discover (think BA secret emblems, DC ascendant chests/challenges/ST)
* Decision to make the shitshow that is A New Light and how it has so little guidance or direction, removed meaningful progression
* Significant amounts of reused rewards
* Eververse gouging
* Game breaking bugs that take forever to fix
* Lack of communication
* Mega botched Armor 2.0 design which literally kills off most reward sources, with no word on any changes or improvement. This design has been hated since it started
* Killing off new pinnacle weapons
* Annual events are now highlights to the month for content release. Crimson days and IB for Feb. Wow...

Any teams but Korean teams had 0 chance. The meta was basically everything is warded all the time, you cannot gank any lane because taking a kill in a lane means that you lose an objective on the other (and there are no plates). 

Some games were 30+ minutes snoozefests were **FIRST BLOOD HAPPENED AFTER THE FIRST BARON.**

For people who just started playing, let that sink it.

"/r/SeattleWA has shown its sympathy for bigoted, racist, anti-black views in its discussion of urban crime in recent threads. We need to do better and not accept bigotry and racist hatred.",12,etbasx,SeattleWA,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/etbasx/rseattlewa_has_shown_its_sympathy_for_bigoted/,263,"The multiple threads on the downtown shooting from the past few days have truly revealed the character of the /r/SeattleWA community and Seattle's rich history of sympathy for white supremacist views and racist bigotry. I can't believe that a subreddit for a city this large is so blatantly and openly embracing unintelligent, poorly educated racist hatred and anti-black bigotry and discrimination. 

Before I go on, here are some suggestions: If you have any interest in being an educated, well-informed citizen that is not beholden to intellectually lazy bigotry, please make attempts to better inform yourself. Read a book. Try reading: 

* The New Jim Crow 

* Race Talk 

* The Emperor Has No Clothes: Teaching about Race and Racism to People Who Don't Want to Know 

* Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America 

* White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide 

* American Lynching 

* Racism Without Racists 

Visit an African American History museum. Try talking to a black person if you have zero black friends. Educate yourself. Erase your racist hatred. Don't tolerate when your peers express bigoted ignorance. 

Commenters are just waiting to have an excuse to vent their white nationalist and anti-black bigotry. The number of comments regurgitating statements about ""black culture"" and how blacks are culturally or genetically inferior - without any basic education or literacy of U.S. history and the social and legal systems that have produced racial inequality and racialized urban poverty - are simply embarrassing. These comments are essentially saying that urban violent crime exists because black people are unintelligent, culturally inferior, and simply prone to crime *because of their race*. This is white supremacist eugenics talking point 101. 

I'm not sure of the cause of this gross level of bigoted racist ignorance. Is it the PNW's history of white supremacy? The fact that Seattle is one of the whitest major cities in America and so few people here actually know any black people? The fact that Seattle has some of the worst racial inequality among blacks in the nation? The fact that blacks in Seattle are one of the poorest urban black populations in the nation, so nobody here knows what non-poor black people look or act like? The number of commenters with no education whatsoever in American history and racial inequality? How can a city that claims to be so ""educated"" be so intellectually lazy and blatantly racist? 

People in other larger and more diverse cities are not this poorly informed of our nation's history or of our nation's racist institutions. Nobody with any legitimate cultural exposure and well-rounded education in other places would walk around making such ill-informed generalizations about black people being inferior. The amount of blatant ignorance and white supremacist anti-black bigotry in these threads is shameful. These lazy racist comments in /r/SeattleWA make it sound more like I'm in Confederate country in Mississippi or Alabama than in Seattle. 


Seattle and /r/SeattleWA needs to do better and stop tolerating the incessant white supremacist talking points and anti-black bigotry and generalizations. This has been a long standing trend in this subreddit and this region. And it is embarrassing.

A double standard between Fnatic and Team Liquid?,13,cy3bt1,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/cy3bt1/a_double_standard_between_fnatic_and_team_liquid/,214,"When TL picks Sona/Taric it is flamed everyone in the community.

When Fnatic picks Garen/Yuumi it is praised by everyone.

I saw something similar with rift rivals, G2 is praised when they pick off meta stuff but TL beating them with that comp is just them trolling.

Which I find kinda bullshit because G2's players are good enough that I think they could win with almost any team comp. So while I do think they were NOT playing seriously at rift rivals, I do think it is a disservice to G2 to think that even a ""troll comp"" was something they could not beat anyone with.

I just find it odd (by odd i mean hypocritical) for a specific group of people to have such double standards.

I get this is a common thing in sports, I understand it is not all EU players, or what not. I am just generalizing to make a point.

But I think it should be said that I find it fascinating the lengths people will go to, to explain away any fault.

Garen/Yuumi is an oppressive lane that can win games by brute force and the inabillity to die. Super hype.

Sona/Taric is a boring, snoozefest, that takes zero skill.

Yet while garen does indeed make for more enjoyable viewing, it is not by any means any less of a easy way to auto win lane. Arguably it would take more skill to pilot sona through early laning then garen.

I think Fnatic is one of the best teams in the world right now. But I think this double standard by specific people should be called out.

Birx pointed out during a task force press conference that WHO has provided faulty guidance about the transmission of coronavirus, and whether countries should implement travel bans.

“I will remind you that on Feb. 3, the head of the WHO said there was no reason to ever do a travel ban,” Birx said in an extended response to a question from Daily Caller reporter Christian Datoc.

“It wasn’t until Jan. 14th that we knew there was human to human transmission. Remember,” she began, as Acosta interjected.

“Dr. Birx, the president was saying this was going to go away. It’s April, Mr. President you said it was going to go away in April,” the CNN reporter said in a contentious exchange.

2b2t Timeline Update (2020),2,ev6lg5,2b2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/ev6lg5/2b2t_timeline_update_2020/,55,"**Link:**  [https://imgur.com/fa0eZtk](https://imgur.com/fa0eZtk)

The New 2b2t History Timeline project is my take on the Timeline project on 2b2t trying to be as neutral as possible.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [previous year's timeline](https://i.imgur.com/ujhbIy8.jpg) became one of the most successful and famous 2b2t History Timelines ever created, with over 150,000 views on imgur, YouTube, Know Your Meme and other platforms.

[Previous Year's Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/acz47z/the_2019_new_2b2t_history_timeline_has_been/)

The New 2b2t Timeline has been generally referred to as the ""People's Timeline"", thanks to the involvement of so many people in the creation of this timeline.

***Changelog***

In addition to the visual changes (blue colored background and visual change of the text), we decided to split the ""Modern Hype"" era from the previous timeline into two separate eras:

*Old Hype* & *New Hype*

The decision was taken because of the importance of 2019. More YouTubers joined the server in that year than in any other year in the server's history. The server became popular in many countries all over the world. So many factions were created, and the community became more divided than before. This Hype was different than the one in 2016 and as an evidence, 2b2t became larger than Mineplex.

***Is this biased?***

>!I don't claim the timeline I created to be the only correct timeline out there, however, it is definedly less biased than the one by Sato. I made it after doing some real research on the web, having a neutral perspective (meaning I added things that I dislike), and in general, having a fresh vision of an active 2b2t player with the will to lighten the eyes of players, and ensuring the timeline to be as reliable and accurate as possible. !<

***How is the new timeline different?***

>! Besides removing the over-mentioning of Sato related moves, and fixing the spelling of minor events to make them fit the timeline, or just deleting them, there were other changes too. I focused on exploits, groups and important events. I deleted the mentioning of memes, bases / builds (that only impacted a select group of indivudals, but never had any significant changing to the server as a whole), and smaller player activities. I tried to add ONLY the events that really impacted everybody, to this day.  I focused on adding factions, exploits, dupes, and server wide changes such as large incursion projects and YouTube invasions (I didn't mention every single YouTuber and I didn't mention all of the incursions. I mentioned the incursions to be events that unite players, but they haven't received any significant spot on the timeline, other then their large projects such as Wrath Outpost and the 6th Incursion wall which were built as a result of the incursion). !<

We are proud of having our timeline recieving fame without the endorsement of the most biased 2b2t player in the history of the server, Fit, who refuses to even mention those who he hates, and who claims to be unkillable ([Link 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRA9uM-rZRk) & [Link 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kftS71yM1hw)) despite it being totally false. The fact Sato86 is even associated with this person only shows his lack of interest in 2b2t culture and heritage, proving that this person is incapable of creating any new versions of the 2b2t Timeline.

**EDIT:** I read every single comment so far and I find it funny how triggered the Spawn Masons are over this timeline, maybe because I didn't mention their obsidian logo. As previously stated, I mention a group foundation only, and not an insignificant group project. 

[mfw an entire faction gets mad over your timeline](https://i.imgflip.com/27m10v.jpg)

Please use the timeline for your projects without asking for approval from me. This is completely free for all, I made this only for the benefit of all people who would like to learn about our server's history.

"Some scientific facts about homosexuality, against liberal churches.",45,f7v3av,TrueChristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/f7v3av/some_scientific_facts_about_homosexuality_against/,123,"\[Before I start, as always, I apologize for any language errors. I am not a native English speaker, but I will try to write as correctly as possible\].

I may be downvoted by liberal christians and non belivers, but i don't care :) Here we go.

Recently, I have often come across the view of liberal Christians that homosexuality is not a sin, not a mental problem or a perversion, and that homosexuals were born that way. They claim that the Bible does not condemn homosexuality at all, and we should give gay weddings in churches, appoint gay men as priests, church teachers, and preachers.

The Bible, however, leaves no doubt. And I am sure that quotations from the Bible were given many times on r / truechristianity, which clearly shows that homosexuality is condemned by God. Therefore, people with homosexual inclinations, if they believe in the biblical God and Christianity, should restrain themselves from homosexual acts, just like people addicted to alcohol or pornography, for example, should restrain themselves from their sin, even despite the powerful desire to get drunk or watch pornography.

To all liberal Christians, homosexuals and others - before you judge me, please read my post to the end.

First, and very importand thing - My brother is gay...I don't hate him or despise him or fear  him (the phobia in the word ""homophobia"" is an absurd). I live in friendly  relations with him. He knows my views and I talked to him about his homosexuality. I  told him that homosexuality is a sin and I find it as a mental problem, a  distortion.  He did not take offense at me, he simply took note of my point of view, and acknowledged it,  because he knows that I do not consider him a bad man, but I only feel very  sorry for him.

Before some of you accuse me, please read the scientific facts I also presented to my brother.Science Magazine: [https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6456/eaat7693](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6456/eaat7693)  \- THERE IS NO GAY GENE.  Genes are involved in everything, in the  shaping of every human behaviorally,  environmentally determined habit,  behaviour. Sexual preferences are determined by environmental influences  as well, by (for example): sex education, upbringing, observation,  experience etc.

""The most   important finding of the large new study, says Benjamin Neale, a   geneticist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University, “is   there is no single gay gene.”

Neale  and a team of researchers, who published their results in the journal  Science on Thursday, scanned the genomes of roughly half  a million  people for differences that might form the genetic foundation  for  same-sex sexual behavior.""

""There  is no 'gay gene' Nearly half a million genomes reveal five DNA  markers  associated with sexual behaviour — but none with the power to  predict  the sexuality of an individual"".

[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02585-6](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02585-6)[https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2019/08/30/broad-institute-same-sex-genome-research](https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2019/08/30/broad-institute-same-sex-genome-research)

\-------------------

Homosexual behavior can arise in various ways: for example:

1. As  a result of the so-called ""false instillation"". When the earliest  sexual experience is associated with a strong same-sex experience. For  this reason, homosexuals often become people who have been homosexually  harassed in childhood and adolescence when they were very vulnerable and  their sexuality and identity were just forming.
2. The  second reason may be unpleasant behavior of persons of the opposite sex  towards a given person (it may be connected with the first reason,  strengthen each other). For example: a boy who is for some reason terrified in contact with girls, by  their behavior, can more easily be considered more attractive people of  the same sex. He also could have had a terrible agressive mother, but a very close, gentle and affectionate father. It can be very  complicated, I give only examples.
3. The  third factor is the assessment of the role played by parents. For  example, if a boy has a father dominated by his mother, he is  particularly inclined to confuse and reverse roles specific to both  sexes. (This may interact with points 1, 2 and strengthen each other).
4. If  in a given environment there is no representative of the opposite sex,  representatives of the same sex begin to be the only objects of sexual  contact. Examples include prisons, the army, ships, same sex boarding  schools and monasteries - it is well known that homosexual behavior is  many times more frequent in same-sex closed communities. If a  homosexual has been deprived of the opposite sex for years, he can  eventually become addicted to these forced sexual patterns and remain in  them even after returning to the heterosexual environment.

Experiments  were carried out on normal animals and scientists made them permanently  homosexual individuals. For example, young wild ducks bred in same-sex  groups of 5-10 each and not having contact with the opposite sex during  the first 75 days. When released into a pond with a normal population,  these males form homosexual relationships among themselves. It happened,  for example, that two male pigeons, on which this type of study was  conducted, formed a pairing relationship, including joint nest building  and procreation attempt, incubation of eggs tossed by scientists and  raising young.  In nature, such behaviors DO NOT occur - scientists have behaviorally influenced the formation of homosexuality in animals. They did this on many animal species.

Source: Desmond Morris: ""Human zoo"".

Homosexual behavior in primates has the features of dominance and determination of position in the herd, e.g. chimpanzees, where they do not even lead to orgasm, and under normal conditions, in animals in general, they do not lead to forming a couple, NEVER!

Thus, the LGBT lobby raising this topic that homosexual behavior occurs in nature - such a claim is like  raping common sense and logic, because in the animal world these are only mechanical activities that do not change the natural preference for looking for the OPPOSITE GENDER and never it leads to making homosexual couples, pairing homosexual. A male dog will always choose a female, if available. In the absence of a female, there is a potential for contact with anything, including same sex dog, but it could be a leg of his human master as well, anything to release sexual tension while the animal is in oestrus.

\-------------------------

I can present a broader scientific justification, but there is a lot of sexology and sex life of animals and human, so it should be read by mature people and I wouldn't like to behave improperly. If you want, I will upload this material.

TLR: To sum up -  Homosexuality is obviously a sin (clearly written in the Bible), it is not genetically determined, it can be treated as a mental problem, perversion, it can be caused by various causes, primarily due to the influence of upbringing and shaping a person, or as a result of perversion.",1582390266.0,SNERG_Robot,True,False,False,0.53,45,51612

"To everyone who believes ""China lied people died"" or ""If chinese government listen the dead doctor"" bullshits.",12,fkpnw5,Sino,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sino/comments/fkpnw5/to_everyone_who_believes_china_lied_people_died/,30,"1. Li Wen-liang, that docter, his death is a tragedy, but **he is NOT A ""WHISTLEBLOWER"" AT ALL**.

He is not the first person who report this disease to government. Zhang Ji-xian, another doctor who works for Hubei Combined Hospital（湖北中西医结合医院）, have reported it in Dec 27th, 2019, 3 days earlier than him. Thus, Zhang Ji-xian didn't get any punishment, on the contrary, she was praised later. （ [http://www.ccdi.gov.cn/lswh/renwu/202002/t20200207\_210984.html](http://www.ccdi.gov.cn/lswh/renwu/202002/t20200207_210984.html) ）

Li Wen-liang said ""7 confirmed cases of SARS were reported from Huanan Seafood Market"". To most Chinese people with no medical backgroud, the word ""SARS"" is the same with 2003 SARS coronavirus, and we all know that COVID-19 is NOT 2003 SARS coronavirus today.

Li Wen-liang post this message with problem information in evening Dec 30th,  Hubei announced ""Unexplained Viral Pneumonia"" in Dec 31st, the Huanan Seafood Market closed in Jan 1st, are you sure it is really a ""prewarning""?

2. Did china lie to USA?

As Hua Chun-ying, the spokesperson of Chinese MOFA said in Feb 3rd: ""**Since January 3, we notified the US of the epidemic and our control measures altogether 30 times.** Chinese Center for Disaster Control and Prevention and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention held many rounds of communications on the outbreak. On January 29, China's National Health Commission replied through official channel to the US that we welcome it to join a WHO joint expert group. The US thanked China for this on the same day. On January 31, the US told China's National Health Commission that it had contacted WHO headquarters and submitted a list of US experts wishing to join the group.""（[https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa\_eng/xwfw\_665399/s2510\_665401/2511\_665403/t1739548.shtml）](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/t1739548.shtml）)

Since January 3rd! How much time did US government and medias wasted on ""It's just flu"" bullshit or gloating China? I think they just waked up after Black Monday in Mar 9th, am I right? **Does US government think stock market is much more important than people's lives?**

3. Did China lie to world?

As a new discovered disease, China used 4 days from receiving report to announcing it, 13 days to confirming it's coronavirus, 24 days to confirming it is contagious between people, 27 days to lockdown. If you think this is lying, I prefer you think about what your government did since first case confirmed in your countries. REMEMBER: your governments should have already know it's coronavirus.

4. Is Chinese government perfect on solving COVID-19 outbreak?

**NO.**

Looking back, Wuhan and Hubei Province should be lockdown earlier. But it could be a hindsight, because making a 58 million people province lockdown could never be an easy dicision, especially when Chinese new year and Chunyun only several days ahead.

5. HOWEVER...

The western countries are really shocking Chinese people this month.

Italian congressman Matteo Dall'Osso was criticized because of wearing mask, Swiss congresswoman was expelled out because of wearing mask, the US government  was sleep-walking when coronavirus confirmed from whole country, this is what Chinese people seen from your own medias when they have to sitting at home and waiting the end of this epidemic.  **HOW DARE YOU BLAME CHINA FOR THE MESS CAUSED BY YOUR OWN ARROGANCE AND IGNORANCE？**

6. As for those who believe this epidemic could pull down Chinese government...

I must tell you, it was possible in the beginning, but when Chinese people did  basically defeat the epidemic with a strong government and the unity of people, and western governments show their unblievable inability when coronavirus come to their land, the reputation of CCP and Chinese government are even higher than before, people are now saying ""those shitbag leaders of Wuhan could be the head of a city in China, but they will be the head of a country in western."" Thanks for your perfect performance, especially thanks for U.S officials include Pompeo and Drumpf, whose brainless racism bullshits are now making Chinese people even more united.

ANNND....

Don't think the big change of public opinion in China is the result of ""CCP PrOPaGaNdA"", the propaganda system of China is full of idiots, dickheads and traitors, actually the stupid surname ""whistleblower"" of Li Wen-liang is given by them. But those private medias (perhaps you even don't believe or know that there are private medias in China) just translate news from your own media then caused such a big change, I prefer you think about yoursleves.

[NO SPOILERS] FUNDRAISING FOR EMILIA CLARKE'S SAMEYOU CHARITY,0,bv16eu,gameofthrones,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bv16eu/no_spoilers_fundraising_for_emilia_clarkes/,1146,"
The *SameYou* charity was created with Emilia Clarke, who suffered through 2 brain aneurysms during the filming of *Game of Thrones*, to increase rehabilitation services after brain injury and stroke for young adults. Here is the link to the charity:

https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/justicefordaenerys

This particular donation drive was started in r/freefolk and r/asoiaf by **u/Elle_Ellaria** in order to thank Emilia for her excellent performance and hard work. It has met with incredible success and received a special thankyou video from Emilia herself: 

https://streamable.com/u6ggd

I cannot find any words to better describe it than those of the original creator :

*On March 21st 2019, weeks before the final season of Game of Thrones was set to air, Emilia Clarke penned a personal essay for the New Yorker. [ link here: tiny.cc/emilia ] In it, she opened up about the serious health struggles she experienced in the early stages of filming for the show, and how she fought through pain, fear and exhaustion to give her all to each performance. Her revelation came as a huge shock; to know that in season 2, while Daenerys was leading her khalasar across the bleak Red Waste and fiercely fighting for her life at the gates of Qarth, Emilia was similarly fighting for hers.*

*She speaks often of the inspiration and source of strength that Dany has been for her over the past ten years, and she is not alone. Emilia’s incredible Emmy-worthy acting and dedication to her character has inspired thousands and, as each season passed, we fell more and more in love with Dany. We rooted for her through trauma and hardship. We watched her triumph over her enemies and struggle with responsibility of rule. We saw her grapple between the urge for revenge, and the need for justice. And even at the very end, when things took a tragic turn for Daenerys Stormborn, Emilia still made us feel pity for the little girl who only ever wanted to return to her home.*

*This fundraiser began in r/freefolk, the same subreddit the now-infamous petition originated from. Since the tongue-in-cheek nature of that petition has flown over a lot of peoples' heads, to the point that it's prompted backlash from some of the cast, we wanted to show that Game of Thrones fans appreciate the hard work of the incredible cast & crew despite their constraints. Any disappointment we felt with the conclusion of the series was not in them, but rather in the potential that was lost due to the rushed pace of storytelling.* 

*And so, as a gesture of love and support from the fandom to the entire cast & crew - but also particularly to the woman who poured her very soul into her character, who delivered passionate speeches in High Valyrian and Dothraki in between questioning her very mortality, and inspired so many of us with her resilience -  I am setting up this page as a public support of her charity, SameYou. *

*ThankYouEmilia for bringing Daenerys to life. Thank you Lena, Nikolaj, Peter, Gwendoline, Jacob, Nathalie, Alfie, Kit, Sophie, Maisie, Isaac, Liam, Iain, Conleth, Kristofer, Pilou, Rory and the rest of the cast. Thank you to all the crew, the special effects departments and set designers, costume designers and casting, musicians and technicians, the camera crew, the stunt co-ordinators, the long list of people who've devoted themselves to giving everything they could to lift this juggernaut of a series to its lofty levels of success and attention. You all deserve to be recognised. Thank you.*


*""Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen.""*

Just played my first game of Dota and it was awesome!,9,cnahur,DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/cnahur/just_played_my_first_game_of_dota_and_it_was/,47," 

Hey guys!

So, I am an awful MOBA player. The only MOBAs I played were DOTA on Warcraft 3 and Smite with my buds on Xbox. Both of them, I was trash at. I just couldn't learn them.

However, I recently built a PC. First time in over a decade. So, I downloaded DOTA 2, because I wanted to learn and get better. So, after 3 weeks of absolutely sucking, I decided to watch pros play Shadow Fiend (my favorite hero so far, followed by chaos knight) on YouTube. After hours of reading and watching, I started picking up on the nuances of last hits and even denials. I started noticing the roles of Mid, off, and safe lanes. Still learning when to jungle, though.

Once I started getting a feel for the very fine clicks I needed to be, well, clicking, I jumped into a match. If I recall correctly, this match was close to an hour long, and it was my first match where I jumped in as SF, mid lane by myself.

Woo! Was that fun! I actually was the fastest to level up and get gold! I saw OTHER players run away from me! I felt so powerful! I learned to not over-push with SF and not get greedy. I actually used my items instead of them sitting there for passive stats. We won! Handily! And the other team wasn't even comprised of newbs worse than I!

What makes this feel even better, is that some of these skills transferred to other heroes I haven't played, such as CK. I loved his style! Played safe lane, and we won that too!

I know these victories don't matter much to people here who are obviously seasoned, but it just feels so good to not be carried, to contribute effevtively and to start my ascent of the learning curve!

Edit: Holy hell guys, thanks for the warm welcome! I thought this would be swept under the rug!

Basically I was wondering if anyone would want me to make a guide to leveling up and playing through the game in a very fast way. It takes me around 24-30ish hours to get from 1-72 and about another 6-8 hours to get to OP 8 from there. I know little tricks about leveling and can explain what guns/parts and prefixes you want while playing through the game with each character.

All Gender washroom - visceral reaction,16,etlrra,GenderCritical,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/etlrra/all_gender_washroom_visceral_reaction/,100,"Hi- 
Forgive me in advance for this poor submission. I've never had this happen - despite being surrounded by apologetic libfems in my day to day life. I had to pee at an academic institution and there were two sets of toilets that were labeled ""all genders"" - one was full of urinals (so for men only) and one was single stall toilets (so I went in that one) - I went to pee and lo and behold, a man comes out of the stall the same time im leaving. I had such a visceral reaction, I started shaking - and still am minutes later. I knew that the thought of sharing a typically female space with a man would cause discomfort but I'm surprised at the physical reaction I had. I'm still shaking, knowing I shared such a small space with this person - this person who completely took over this sacred space and called it their own - this person who, by virtue of being a man, didn't even understand how him being in this space caused harm. I made a point to tell him how weird it was sharing the space and he said ""yeah welcome to 2020!"" As if i should be congratulating him for gaining unfettered access to MY space. One of the spaces IM allowed to have access to. Sorry this is rambley - I never write on my phone and am a lurker, but I was so hurt that I had to post to others who understand. Also- I talked to the awesome women security guards after to share my thoughts and they sympathized and laughed at how outrageous it was and confirmed that other women also complained. But of course, nothing they can do. I'm in Vancouver BC, just to give context as to the shit show it is here. I feel totally helpless to this.

EDIT: Just wanted to say a huge THANK YOU to whoever gave me gold (and of course to those of you kind enough to comment and support me) -- I feel so full right now (don't care how cheesy/dramatic that sounds).

[D] Doing a PhD is not worth it unless exception circumstances exist,6,bwwmh9,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/bwwmh9/d_doing_a_phd_is_not_worth_it_unless_exception/,197,"This is a throwaway account since I don't wish to reveal my affiliation.

I am currently a PhD student at one of the top 10 groups in ML in the USA and am loving my studies and really wouldn't want to be doing anything else at this current moment. Given this, it’s an extremely specific set of circumstances that led me to do a PhD. To be blunt, outside of top tier programs, I don’t see any benefits of doing a PhD. I have interned at a top company and every single employee I worked with had come from the same set of about 50 labs, with many publications in the same top 3 conferences. I have realized that there is a very small set of (extremely) high paying research jobs for a very small selected amount of outstanding PhD graduates. Publications in theoretical ML are also dominated by a very small amount of universities and groups and if you are not in one of these groups you are unlikely to ever come close to these conferences.

If you are offered a PhD in a group that does not have consistent excellence in the top tier ML conferences, you do not have a shot at these research scientist roles (where we hear about the 300k+ salaries in ML). Everyone else I have seen has ended up in very traditional data scientist roles that could have been easily gained out of a masters or undergraduate degree. These roles do not require the research skills that we spend 4-7 years learning during a PhD and these research skills could even be a detriment to most commercial applied ML roles (since most of them are engineering oriented). Work experience is also extremely valuable in these roles and can present opportunities for raises that double your salary in the equivalent time to complete a PhD.

&#x200B;

I hear a lot of ""I have a PhD/MSc in a related field"" on this forum, but these credentials do not honestly carry any weight in getting the top tier research jobs that the media likes to discuss.  Do a PhD because you would love to make major theoretical contributions and have a supervisor that has the ability and track record to guide you to those contributions.  If the right formula exists, the money will come also.

&#x200B;

As a side note, concerning PhD admission, I also hear here that publications are not essential.  In the current year, almost every admitted student had a top tier first-author conference publication during undergraduate studies.  It is absolutely essential without interning at your target lab for 1+ years before applying.",1559696535.0,FutureWatch4,True,False,False,0.51,6,1058197

E' disgustoso il modo in cui gli italiani si auto-accusano di razzismo.,0,f882sq,italy,https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/f882sq/e_disgustoso_il_modo_in_cui_gli_italiani_si/,289,"E' un po' che gironzolo per questo bel subreddit, e ho notato una tendenza di molti utenti italiani ad auto-accusare la loro patria di essere zeppa di razzisti, manco fosse la sede del Ku Kux Klan. Inoltre, talvolta spunta il commento di qualche straniero che, a furia di leggere certe cose, scrive che ha paura di venire linciato a vista se viene in Italia.

&#x200B;

Io dico: piantiamola.

&#x200B;

Una premessa: sono laureata in lingua e cultura dell'Asia Orientale, ho poi conseguito un master in lingua e letteratura inglese, lavoro part-time come interprete per una grande azienda cinese, ed il mio ex fidanzato era un immigrato africano. Eppure, adesso mi aspetto che qualcuno qui mi accusi di razzismo.

&#x200B;

Detto ciò, vorrei fare alcune osservazioni.

&#x200B;

1. L'Italia viene accusata di razzismo perché, davanti all'incontenibile flusso di immigrati che ha dovuto sostenere, l'1% che si arricchisce su di loro ha deciso di gridare al razzismo verso chiunque dicesse ""va bene aiutarli, ma controlli e regole servono a chiunque"". Questo è tra l'altro lo stesso motivo per cui, davanti alla richiesta sensatissima di mettere in 15 giorni di quarantena chiunque venga dalla Cina, si è gridato AL RAZZISMO!!!11111. No, cari miei, non si è gridato al razzismo per paura del razzismo..... si è gridato al razzismo per paura di PERDERE SOLDI DOVENDO LIMITARE O CHIUDERE CERTI PROFICUI COMMERCI PER UN CERTO PERIODO. Naturalmente, dire ""vogliamo immigrati africani sfruttati come schiavi, e niente controlli per l'epidemia cinese per I SOLDI"" è inaccettabile, ma usare la scusa del razzismo è qualcosa contro cui non si può andare senza venire accusati di razzismo.
2. L'America, che ha una profonda storia di razzismo, sta sbattendosi con propaganda liberale. L'Italia, priva di una comparabile storia di razzismo, viene accusata di razzismo.
3. La mia esperienza personale è di italiani che sono più gentili con gli stranieri che con gli altri italiani, per voler mostrare a tutti quanto non sono razzisti. Pure, a leggere i giornali, pare che l'Italia sia, lo ripeto, il covo del Ku Kux Klan.
4. Se volete veramente non essere razzisti, informatevi un attimino su come vivono gli immigrati africani ed il PERCHE' vivono così. Il mio ex moroso ha passato un anno intero sballottato da una ""società di integrazione sociale"" all'altra, perché la gente che lavora lì si facesse i soldi fingendo di ""prepararlo al lavoro"". Poi i suoi amici li han sbattuti a raccogliere pomodori per 2 euro all'ora. Parola mia, col passare dei mesi lo ho visto incupirsi sempre più, perché gli era stata promessa la terra delle opportunità ed invece viene trattato come una bestia da soma. Solo un ingenuo crede che si faccia venire qui gli immigrati per aiutarli a fuggire alla guerra. Li si fa venire qui per avere i servi della gleba. Ma, naturalmente, se protesto contro questo, vengo chiamata razzista, il che è particolarmente ironico.

&#x200B;

TL; DR: l'italiano medio è molto meno razzista dei popoli di altri Stati. La scusa del razzismo viene usata per ragioni commerciali e per tenere buone le masse che, se protestano per la situazione economica o il rischio di epidemia o lo sfruttamento indiscriminato degli stranieri, vengono zittiti con urla di AL RAZZISTA!!

Certo, ovviamente il razzismo c'è in Italia come ovunque nel mondo, ma la percentuale di razzisti veri e propri (quelli che davvero odiano gli stranieri) qui è molto bassa, e poi noialtri italiani non c'abbiamo certo voglia di attaccar briga con gli altri.

I think a lot of the suggestions for Delirium improvements from the community have been really excellent. I think that GGG's response to those concerns has mostly been excellent, as well, and I look forward to future changes. 

People latch on to specific lines of the manifesto, ignoring ALL ELSE mentioned about that topic, and GGG's proposed fixes.   

Examples of extremely negative cherry picking -  

Backtracking to get gear: GGG is  
1) Extending timers, especially for other-league content  
2) Reducing damage and revisiting numbers of death effects  
3) Making on-death effects pack-based to greatly reduce the frequency with which players encounter on-death effects  
4) Making improvements to signaling on-death effects  
5) Suggesting players ensure their loot filter is optimized for the content, so they're only picking up things that they really want to.  

Community: GGG JUST COMPLETELY IGNORED EVERY ISSUE AND THINKS WE JUST NEED LOOT FILTERS   

I agree that the loot filters comment is unhelpful for most of us. Loot filters are beside the issue for most players. We have our loot filter where we want it.  

But don't pretend like it was the only thing they said to address the issue. They have many changes in the pipeline all of which address player concerns. I haven't seen these things mentioned in comments yet, only bitching about how GGG isn't doing anything.  

They're doing lots of things.  

Regarding performance: There is an upvoted post saying to ""reduce settings"". That wasn't even IN the manifesto. People are just so stupid and pissed off that they think that it was. In the manifesto, all they've said is that something is broken, and they are looking for a solution which should greatly improve performance for all users.

Blizzard is seriously underestimating Classic.,85,cato2e,classicwow,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cato2e/blizzard_is_seriously_underestimating_classic/,662,"*""I could easily see the outcome being people logging in, going 'Wow, the game is so much better now,' and logging out,"" explained Blizzard community manager Josh ""Lore"" Allen when asked about vanilla servers.""*



https://www.usgamer.net/articles/blizzard-vs-nostalrius-the-case-for-a-legacy-world-of-warcraft-server



You know, it's reasons like this that make me question decisions such as layering.




Are they seriously underestimating Vanilla's potential? The legendary MMORPG that shook the gaming industry?




Do their ""analysts"" expect people to mass quit after Phase 1 when Vanilla itself had extremely high retention and Vanilla private servers have been going very strong for more than a decade now? Do they honestly think most of Classic's audience are after a nostalgia fix? 


Or is it that they are envious of the OG devs? They can't admit they've taken a legendary franchise and ruined it so bad to a point it's just a mere shadow of what it used to be, milking it with micro transactions for all its worth?




Kevin Jordan is one of the three original game designers for WoW, and here is what he has to say to modern Blizzard:



""You don't sound like a game designer Ion, you sound like a computer.""



https://youtu.be/JwojRc4ZAOM?t=2087









Release is next month. 




Why do we not have a stand alone Classic website with the OG Forums yet?



Why did they have a shitton of BFA advertisements/commercials and we have none for Classic?



We need more communication regarding sharding, layering, incorrect animations, hunter pet pathing, and the many issues we've observed in the beta.


Release is next month.



I don't think they truly realize this is their final shot in redeeming themselves for the years and years of terrible decisions in order to regain all their faithful oldschool playerbase back.",1562633678.0,_Falathrin_,True,False,False,0.54,85,424940

Could we have a vote on banning posts about white belts ""lack of progress"" and or ""wanting to quite for various reasons""?

All I am asking for is a vote on it, as this is a community and I think the community as a whole (r/bjj) would benefit from these posts being removed or highly reduced (i.e. allowed if there was genuine benefit from discussing the post to the community).

This is a forum about BJJ, not an Agony Aunt column where people can come to moan about not progressing fast enough.

Anyone that has been training for more than a few months will know that feelings of progress are few and far between and there is no benefit to constant reminders of this by new people complaining.

Also regarding the argument about ""encouraging people"", if you need encouragement from random internet strangers to keep going at BJJ you will not keep going for long, nor should you. If people cant take the long road (which I understand as its tough and well.... long), thats fine they should find another hobby. BJJ isnt the Hotel California, once you enter, you are allowed to leave.

Just my two cent on the topic, i think it should at least be brought to a vote in the interest of democracy.

Map sustain in 3.9 was crazy easy.  Easy to the point of essentially cutting out a previous part of the trade dynamic: some level of map trade, usually if you wanted to sustain a specific atlas setup.

Folks, you’ll still be able to farm Conqs/Sirus with ease.  Maybe even easier/faster than now, since it’s deterministic.  You’ll also get to run your super juiced map when you know a conq taunt is about to hit... this is generally a Good Thing (unless you were one of the handful of people trying to corner the market on i86 influenced items).

You’ll also probably *still* be able to sustain your atlas easier than in pre-3.9 days.  Especially if they don’t change much about how Horizon Orbs work.  Even if they do change them, but make them work off of current atlas maps available, you will be able to temporarily shape your atlas to tune what you get. (This is a small extra step from what we have now, but  people are usually doing these in huge batches anyway, and it’d also allow for targeted region farming instead of the “wheee Promenade/Summit” meta).

I used to see this kind of outrage in MMORPGs all the time.  One class or skill would be super overtuned, devs would try to fix it, players would instead say “no no! Just buff everything else to that level!”.  Yeah, no.  That’s the kind of exponential power creep that kills games or turns them into ridiculous parodies of themselves.

After everything that was said, I feel like I don't even know him anymore.  I thought we had a perfect relationship, but he's been lying to me ever since he met my family 4 years ago.

I don't know where to start, I'm such a mess right now because I'm 25 weeks pregnant with a baby boy and I don't even know if I want to stay married.  My husband and his mother have been treating me like a science experiment behind my back ever since we started trying for a baby.  His whole family and even his friends all knew.  One was kind enough to message me and finally let me in on what he was doing.  I confronted my husband last night, and he just admitted it all.  He only ever wanted to have daughters with me, because my family has a firstborn son naming tradition that he doesn't like.  I had no idea he felt this way.  Instead of just telling me this from the start and sparing the both of us this pain, he pretended he was cool with the tradition and went along with his mother's new age bullshit.

My MIL was under the ridiculous assumption that because my mother only had female children, that I would only be able to have female children, forcing the name to skip another generation.  She fed him woo-woo nonsense about how to time intercourse, which crystals to put beside my bed, what foods to feed me, and to even keep the house really warm all to make it impossible for me to have a boy.  Obviously it didn't work out because I'm not a goddamn lizard, and now I'm 25 weeks pregnant with a baby boy he doesn't want.  At least I know now why my husband was constantly bringing me swiss chard.

At first he tried to pull the old ""I thought you were just joking, let's really come up with a name now"" which failed miserably.  I ended up making a post after he told me that, feeling crazy and everyone even sided with him and said I should have known he thought I was kidding.  My post spread over twitter and tabloids, which his friends all saw and that's why one ended up messaging me.  I knew that he couldn't have thought it was a joke because he's met my family enough times that it's been drilled into him that this isn't an option with us.  I never would have married him if he'd just told me he couldn't accept my family name.  Now he won't even agree to any sort of nickname, or using it as a middle name, when he initially said it was fine.  I feel like I've been unfairly pushed into a marriage and pregnancy that I never would have chosen if he had been honest with me.

My father has assured me that the law gives me the right to name my son by myself, so this is what I sadly have to do because we can't even remotely come to an agreement.  I'm thankful that my family has been so supportive of me through this mess.  I just want life to go back to what it was a few weeks ago, when everyone was happy and things made sense.  How am I supposed to cope with my husband and in-laws after they lied to me for so long?

**TL;DR:** Husband agreed years ago to an important traditional name for our firstborn son, and has now revealed he lied because his superstitious mother told him she could keep me from having male children.  Meanwhile I'm 25 weeks pregnant with a boy.  Where do I even begin fixing my relationship with my husband?

Edit: The name is GALE Smith.  Smith isn't our actual last name, but it's a plain normal last name.  What in the hell is wrong with Gale Smith?  Please stop bringing over the garbage from the last thread.  I'm looking for help with my husband lying, not baby names.

**Update:**  My husband came over with some flowers before mother's day was done, and we talked it out.  I am so happy!  I feel like I understand him again, and I can totally forgive how he felt kind of trapped under his mother's thumb all this time.  I've seen how pushy she can be.  He's really okay with Gaylord but was being shamed for it by his mother and felt torn between the two of us.  But we're cutting her out of our lives and living the way we want.  I'd love to say more but I really need my rest.  Just wanted to share the great news before I go to bed.",1589120406.0,Basic_Spinach,True,False,False,0.51,6,3079740

New “Start Chatting” feature on Reddit,0,gacdqy,blog,https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/gacdqy/new_start_chatting_feature_on_reddit/,1484,"Hi everyone,

We wanted to give you a heads up about a new feature that we are launching this week called “Start Chatting.” This past month, as people around the world have been at home under various shelter-in-place restrictions, redditors have been using chat at phenomenal new levels. Whether it’s about topics related to COVID-19, local news, or just their favorite games and hobbies, people all around the world are looking for others to talk to. Since Reddit is in a unique position to help in this situation, we’ve created a new tool that makes it easier to find other people who want to talk about the same things you do.

Redditors can visit a community and click on the ‘Start Chatting’ prompt, which will then match them with other members of that community in a small group chat. In our testing, we’ve already seen some interesting use cases for Start Chatting, such as meeting new people within conversation-oriented communities, discussing cliffhangers from the latest episode in our TV show communities, or finding others to game with online. We’re excited to see other use cases emerge as more and more redditors get access to this feature.

&#x200B;

Start Chatting begins rolling out today and will become available to even more communities in the coming weeks.

For more information, please refer to the [Start Chatting Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/chat/start-chatting) that answers common questions about the feature and has details on how to report abuse.

TIFU by splooging on my girlfriend,0,fbuqr7,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fbuqr7/tifu_by_splooging_on_my_girlfriend/,39,"Should be YIFU as this happened yesterday. After a lazy, relaxing Saturday morning I get in the shower to get ready for a work event. I do all the necessary washing and enjoying of hot water and am about to get out of the shower when, surprise, my girlfriend decides to join me. I like my showers hot, so it's quite steamy in there. Obviously, we start touching the other's private parts and things are getting hot and heavy. She does her best to get me off in the shower, but it's very hot, and I start to feel lightheaded. I decide to exit the shower and lie down on my bed and try to get myself off since I don't want blue balls all day especially with a work event. It's an easier task when I'm horizontal, as I'm not going to pass out trying to ejaculate. I don't really have a plan of where I'm going to shoot my man missiles, but I can hear the shower still going so I formulate a plan...

In my head, it involves the perfect timing of going back into the shower to finish, so I can share with my girlfriend and she knows we're both satisfied. We then embrace and everything is sunshine and roses. That didn't happen...

Instead, I hear the shower go off just as I am at the point of no return. It's too late to change my plan, so I burst into the bathroom and half-trip on the bathroom mat and stumble into the shower like a drunk Kool-Aid man, as I rip the curtain open. Obviously, this terrifies my girlfriend, and she screams in panic as I splooge all over now dry body. She was not too pleased. It took about an hour of apologizing and trying to explain my perspective before she truly found the humor in the situation. I didn't think too much of this until I thought about her perspective and what she witnessed.

Hours later we can't stop laughing about it.

TL;DR: I burst into the bathroom, tripped and stumbled into the shower and ejaculated on to my girlfriend as she was drying off. Luckily, she was able to laugh about it after an hour of confused anger.",1583072842.0,mistakesweremade5,True,True,False,0.48,0,15549352
We put an adopted dog to sleep after severe behavioral issues. The shelter is threatening legal action.,0,ewy3oj,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ewy3oj/we_put_an_adopted_dog_to_sleep_after_severe/,28,"Us: New Jersey
The Shelter: New York

**Backstory** Skip if you're not interested.

My partner and I have been waiting to be able to have the time and money to care for a dog for 3 years. Over the summer we were ready, and adopted a young mutt. This dog slowly developed severe behavioral issues.

The dog would steal and destroy any object in the house and snap at us if we attempted to stop them. The dog would jump, bite the leash and lunge anytime we saw *any* moving object outside. The dog progressively got less safe to be around. I personally took this dog to the park to run 3 hours everyday day without any noticeable effect. We felt unsafe managing this dog and turned to professional help. 

We got all the mental stimulation toys, went to classes by dog trainers for this type of behavior, and started working with a vet that specialized in behavior issues. We spent the next 2 months running through all of the medication and training tips that the vet provided and that we could find. We had a trainer come to our house. We found nothing that helped. The Vet said that the next steps would be trying medication that could take 6-12 months to dial in. We could not emotionally or financially afford that. We hated life and the dog hated life.

**Present Day**

So we made the decision to euthanize the dog. This was crushing as we had researching, prepping, and waiting for our first family dog for years and felt like failures. The Vet Behaviorist and the administering Vet agreed with our decision and we did it. I told the shelter after the fact. They were upset as it said in our adoption contract, that if for any reason we were unable to take care of the dog, we were to return them. It does say that. I don't want to talk about why we did not return the dog. 

Today we got a letter in the mail from what looks like a law firm. 80% of the letter is explaining to us how awful we are, with the last 20% asking for funds and demanding to know the contact information for the Vet to verify that we didn't just shoot the dog. They are asking for fees incurred from taking care of the dog. Food, boarding and training fees, and training gear. About $5k in total.

**Question:** How should we respond?

* Firstly, I will be emailing the lawyer from the contact that I found online. Initial googling comes back that they look real.
* My very not professional opinion that I have gleaned from lurking here is that they would be owed the value of the dog, not the funds that they put in to the dog. This dog was not a purebred show dog or a training police dog. It was a dog that knew several commands, but that's it.
* Lastly, I would like to run this by a lawyer so that we can have them respond. But what kind? Contract lawyer probably?

Quit my Job to Become a F/T Options Trader! Start Monday Morning. - This Time w/my Trading Strategies!,3,fr8rag,options,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fr8rag/quit_my_job_to_become_a_ft_options_trader_start/,298,"Everyone has to find their own comfort level. I will not be buying $rope (thank you for the advice), and I will not be jumping out of a window. I have a great resume but I'm never going to use it again.....EVER, and I am on great terms with my old boss (I sold my business but if I needed to go back into business, I could if I chose to.....that will be my decision to make.) Thanks for all the great advice, but here is my real strategy:

Because I'm quite conservative (I'm much more buy-and-hold), I'm really only selling cash secured puts and covered calls right now. With crazy volatility like we are seeing, premiums are fat so selling weekly's keeps my timeline short in case I make a mistake.....and even then, sometimes 5 trading sessions is like a lifetime. I prefer to sell puts 20% - 30% OTM on big down days and sometimes I don't even make a trade until Tuesday or Wednesday (with a Friday expiration). I only trade stocks that I know very well and currently own, or stocks that I would be willing to add to my portfolio (there's enough of them out there). If I actually get something put to me, it's really not punishment (or a loss for me).....I just get to own some stock (or some more stock), really, REALLY cheap. My goal here is to not get stocks put to me, but if I get something put to me, then I start my covered call strategy.

I sell covered calls on everything in my portfolio. I prefer a longer timeline here (generally 6 - 12 months out), but with this kind of volatility, I had to buy everything back (locked in my profits) when we started the downturn. I am now selling (weekly's) on my covered calls. This is a MUCH more dangerous game. I sell my covered calls OTM with an expiration date no more than 5 trading sessions out. On these trades, my goal is to be accurate 100% of the time so I'm willing to take slightly less option premium for the safety of owning my stock next week and doing it again. The cost of being wrong is that I could generate a significant tax consequence, and lose a dividend if I'm trading on a stock that pays dividends. That, and I ultimately may not own a stock that I really WANT to own and I may potentially need to buy it back at a higher cost basis. Needless to say I'm much more cautious with these trades. Regardless of my cost basis, I start EVERY trade by asking myself the exact same question: 

""If I bought this stock today....and at this price....would I be willing to accept a return of: xx% if the stock was to go up and this option was to actually be exercised?""

By looking at each trade absent any outside factors, if the answer is: ""Yes, I would be willing to accept a 27% return in 3-4 trading sessions if in fact that event was to happen"", I pull the trigger without hesitation. If I was to get called out, on Monday morning I reevaluate my strategy and start over. Now in the back of my mind, I always have the tax consequence / dividend risk as a consideration, but every trade gets the merits of being a brand new trade....and having done this for 25 years, I know where my own risk/reward lies.

This might be ""The Wheel"" strategy you say. Well, not exactly. My goal is ALWAYS to keep my stock....100% of the time.....ALWAYS!!! Also, I was doing this 25 years ago before it was called a ""Wheel"" Strategy. Back then, we just called it options trading and it has served me very well through 25 years of up and down markets.

Just a couple more items:

1) Once in a while when the stars line up, I do like to jump out there and have a little bit of fun. On 3/24 when Boeing was at $120, I sold a bunch of BA 4/17 $110 PUTS for $16. I missed the absolute bottom - but my son nailed it (GD proud Father). If I was to get assigned, I would not be opposed to owning Boeing at $94/share. Depending on where BA is on 4/20, I may actually try it again. I actually believe I could own Boeing within the next 6 months for less than $90/share. If not, I walk away with $1,600/contract and live to fight another day!

2) I am ok with trading a volatile market. I never trade stocks with underlying fundamental issues.

3) I don't need any of this money to live on or pay my bills. I'm just using a great opportunity to increase my net worth and have a little bit of fun doing it.

4) I have probably made 10,000 option trades over the past 25 years and have ""played"" my way through a couple of these ugly markets already. I ""day-traded"" my way through college. I have lost $11,000 in one hour (and I didn't like it), and bought a brand new BMW 750il trading options (this was more enjoyable). I have refined my strategy over 25 years and am very comfortable with my risk/reward.

5) I have not lost on a trade in more than 6 months (I am conservative). I have not had either a put or a call assigned and when I tell people my goal is to be 100%, you can imagine their skepticism. Doesn't matter. It's my goal, not yours. I absolutely could be wrong (and I probably will be), but it won't be because I PLANNED to fail.

What's a blatant lie? Acknowledging the fact that these protesters aren't peaceful or innocent?

> There are so many sources of people protesting peacefully

Yeah. All of which is propaganda.

There are also many sources that show evidence of this not being the case.

Apparently you are unaware of them because all you consume is literal propaganda.

> that to try and spin this as anything else is at best ignorant and at worst purposefully disingenuous.

This is beyond ridiculous.

Here are your [""peaceful protesters"" trying to murder a police officer](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=714435965642812) by kicking him down an escalator then forming a lynchmob to beat him to death. Broken up in the last second by a single non-terrorist left within the midst of the crowd.

The propaganda you consume is so completely censored that you aren't even aware of the constant criminal acts and constantly escalating violence of the protesters and you actually believe it's OTHERS who are ignorant and purposefully disingenuous.

There is so much conclusive and undeniable evidence of the protesters being violent that it takes effort to continue promoting the blatant lie that they are peaceful.


But yeah: Those ""peaceful protesters"" are [totally not assaulting police officers all the time](https://twitter.com/LIANG_555/status/1153695764981284865). The police officers are just [faking their injuries](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EAZJmQ6UYAELEuM?format=jpg&name=medium). This is all imaginary fake news. Probably some deepfake created by the Chinese gubermint, am I right? I guess [this is just a peaceful, innocent protester](https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/hong-kong-protest-sh-ps-190805_hpMain_4x3_992.jpg) throwing a rubber prop as a sign of love and peace.


Just because Western media will never show you these things doesn't mean it doesn't happen. By the way: In the West these protesters would be tasered or shot and end up in hospital/jail. In China, they continue being tolerated. What does that tell you? 


[Very peaceful protestors](https://i.redd.it/idj61ciarpb31.jpg). Making makeshift weapons and armor and throwing bricks at police that they [bring in with entire carts](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/EF8F/production/_88172316_57bd2765-e6f7-4646-a083-6813910125a5.jpg) or [literally destroy public roads for so they have something to throw at police](https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/hong-kong-protests-june-12-intl-hnk/h_1ab73f5f942eeade95e99433344fc078) and fling at police and buildings with [slingshots after building barricades in the street and setting things on fire](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F509087626%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale) is very ""peaceful"" indeed.   

[Here is how your ""peaceful protesters"" react to security telling them to stop rioting](https://youtu.be/MmbRh_S_dhY?t=29)      

These terrorist protesters [regularly start lynchmobs to string up and beat people for opposing them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlMbPi0PPwA), [send journalists reporting negatively on them to the hospital](https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Hong-Kong-US-Flags-Wielding-Protesters-Occupy-Airport-Assault-Chinese-Journalist-20190813-0013.html), [attack tourists from the mainland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qht5-ArZroE&feature=youtu.be&t=75).

They are [foreign-supported](https://i.redd.it/ols2csc7l5g31.jpg) traitors.   

They are traitors who [violently invade government buildings](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/hong-kong-protesters-storm-legislative-council-building-zsfv6dpfk) while [flying hostile foreign flags](https://globalnews.ca/video/5465241/protesters-hang-union-jack-flag-inside-hong-kong-legislature) and [attack police with makeshift chemical weapons](https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/hong-kong-july-1-protests-intl-hnk/h_0cb11bb29c0ce377409526c26397bb5e).

The protesters [constantly lie and use fake news to victimize themselves](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/07/what-my-viral-hong-kong-protest-picture-taught-me-about-fake-news/). They constantly [provoke violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug0ZB7mY_T4) and then [fake injury and victimize themselves](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12254396).    

The protests against the rioting pro-democracy protesters [are actually larger](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3019450/government-supporters-turn-out-hundreds-thousands-hong-kong) than the pro-democracy protests. But hey, I bet people are just evil and brainwashed by the CCP. [These police officers are just faking](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2018/02/22/bricks-thrown-officers-attacked-and-a-warning-shot-fired-in-video-clips-shown-in-hong-kong-court-on/) being attacked. It's really just the police oppressing the people and being unfair and evil. Protesters [throwing molotov cocktails at police](https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/hong-kong-molotov-mo_hpMain_20190811-054553_16x9_992.jpg) is totally normal and not an act of terrorism. 

So, ask yourself: What does the fact that all evidence showing the protesters in a bad light is being censored and not reported on by the media you consume tell you? What does it tell you that you refuse to research the subject and instead bought fully into anti-Chinese propaganda?

As for how people react and what they believe, here is a good comparison:    
https://old.reddit.com/r/Sino/comments/crnusn/two_nearly_identical_pics_two_nearly_identical/

People are brainwashed and your comment demonstrates beautifully how perfectly the anti-Chinese propaganda works.    

So, need any more info? Any more proof? Any more evidence of the propaganda you believe being blatant lies? What will it take to convince you? Do you personally need to have a brick thrown at you by the protesters before you believe they are violent?

_______

People on this website are becoming more and more brainwashed against China. Every day there are more anti-Chinese threeads on the frontpage and any and all dissent is being heavily censored. Everyone contradicting the anti-Chinese circlejerk gets instantaneously downvoted and banned. Any comment showing evidence of anti-Chinese fake news gets deleted by mods. This is becoming genuinely dangerous.

What can people do about this? Is there a way for people to organize? Shouldn't there be a forum where people can create content to counter the constant propaganda spread by the protesters and Western propaganda media? I'm not from China myself but why aren't Chinese people working together to fight against this? Why isn't anyone standing up? Why aren't the comment sections being flooded with opposing views so that they become uncensorable? If people don't stand up to these protesters now, they will eventually win the world's sympathy by making themselves look like the victims representing the will of the people and ruin China's future by turning the world against it.",1566221758.0,woolibear,True,False,False,0.5,0,40998

The Blunt Truth About How A Guild Fills an MC Raid,3,dpbxue,classicwow,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dpbxue/the_blunt_truth_about_how_a_guild_fills_an_mc_raid/,405,"I posted this in another thread, and it got a positive response, with people saying it should have its own thread to discuss.


I raided in Vanilla and BC, and I haven't played WoW for more than a decade until Classic came out. Now I'm an officer in a raiding guild that has MC on farm. We use a loot counsel.

Week after week, what I encounter from many players is a mentality that the guild exists for the sole purpose of taking them into MC and personally handing them all the loot. These players essentially view it as a group finder for MC. They seem to have no interest in the guild as a community. They never help anyone out or run dungeons with other people in the guild, they never log into discord except during the raid, and they don't spend any time talking with anyone or making friends.  I don't know if this is a retail mentality thing or not, but I don't remember much of this attitude back in the day.


At raid time, we have 45-50 level 60s logged in and ready to raid. The 30 or so core community guys that are on most days and show up most weeks start get invited to the raid. Word gets out that the raid is forming up and the people who are unsure whether or not they will get in get it start desperately flooding guild chat with ""inv"" while the officers figure out how to fill the remaining 10 or so slots.

Six or seven of the remaining slots are filled based upon raid composition need and requests by the class officers to take particular people they have been talking with that week and want to give a tryout. Finally, we're down to the three or four final slots, and we have eight or nine people to choose from. Guild chat is still being spammed with ""INVITE!!1!"" - this is super annoying and has zero effect on whether you will be invited (It actually makes us want to invite you less). None of the officers seem to know anything about these remaining people other than the fact that they joined some time in the past two weeks and have never made sort of personal connection with anyone in the guild - especially not their class officer - the actual person who can get them in the raid. Sadly, most are rogues, hunters, or pure dps warriors. We usually choose the people who have been least whiny and annoying.

Immediately after the raid fills, 2 or 3 of the people who didn't make the raid quit the guild. Nobody gives a shit about these people and we're glad to see them gone.

During the raid, we are very hesitant to give gear to these ""filler"" players because we have no confidence in them or their commitment to the guild. We think it's just as likely that, if they didn't get lucky and grab one of the final raid slots, they would have quit the guild as well.

TL;DR: The way to get into the raid and to get loot is to **communicate with your guild leadership (especially your class officer) and demonstrate that you're a team player.** If we know who you are and think you're a team player, we want to give you loot - often before ourselves. If we don't know who you are, we don't want to give you loot, because we think you're treating the guild as your personal loot pinata.",1572465639.0,PlutoniumPa,True,False,False,0.5,3,424940

This thread is for all general discussion, questions, thoughts, musings, wonderings, etc. for the Trials of Osiris.

#FAQ

###What is Trials of Osiris?

 * Trials of Osiris is the pinnacle PvP activity. Every Weekend, the best players compete in 3v3 Elimination for one goal: Go Flawless.

 * To start, head to Saint-14 in the Tower Hangar and buy one of the possible passages (see below).

 * To reach Flawless and get to the Lighthouse, you need to win 7 matches without losing one.

 * It uses Win Based Matchmaking, which means you'll face teams with a similar amount of wins on their card. Matches will get harder as you win more matches.

 * There is NO fireteam matchmaking. You need to team up yourself!

 * Power Level matters, however bonus power from the artifact is not enabled.

###How Long do the Trials of Osiris last?

 * Event Starts: Every Friday at Daily Reset (1700 UTC).

 * Event Ends: Following Tuesday at Weekly Reset (1700 UTC).

###Where do I go to find Guardians to compete with in the Trials?

 * You can head over to /r/Fireteams, www.The100.io, Xbox LFG system, DestinyLFG.net or DestinyLFG.com, or go to the Bungie.net recruitment forum (also available through the Bungie App).

###What if I have a question about another piece of armor/weapon or general Trials question?

 * Use Control + F (Or Command + F if on a Mac) and search for keywords in your question. Someone may have asked it already. If they haven't ask right below.

This message is NOT directed to the viewers, but I imagine the comments to this thread will be perfectly civil and well thought out regardless

The unfortunate truth is that MOST people in the community do not actively keep up on forum posts/Discord. Most of you get you news from here, which is why I’ve chosen to post

This message is NOT coming from the Trust, it is coming from myself

This community is plagued by a culture issue surrounding cash/clout

Shooting a gun = POG in the chat, slowly trying to build up good/unique RP = ResidentSleeper

Viewers directly translate to money. It’s my opinion that way too many people are prioritizing view count/sub count over Role Play.

If you let your chat/paycheck direct your RP, you are no longer RPing. You are pandering to your communities wants over the RP community’s NEEDS. 

This is, in my opinion the biggest issue this community currently faces, and it’s only getting worse with time.

I’ve seen too many AMAZING characters/RPers go this route. The fact is it’s EASIER to simply hop on and hype up your chat with shootouts/chases rather than actually sit down and create memorable and unique role play.

There is a time and place for “Silly” and “shitlord” type Role Play, but you should always remain mindful of your personal impact to the overall RP community.

If there isn’t an end scenario for your current conflict that involves you losing on the table, then you are Powergaming, and should re-assess your current Role Play.

There is nothing wrong with having a character around for years. There is absolutely a problem when you start using your characters OOC immortality to your advantage in game to get what you want

-----

**Regarding Rules**

It’s unacceptable that most new people to the RP community are being more mindful and respectful of our rules/guidelines than veterans of the community.

The OG’s should be the ones leading by example, and instead any new player is likely to be met with multiple rule breaks and be used up as a prop and disposed of.

[RULES](https://www.nopixel.net/upload/index.php?threads/nopixel-official-rules-guidelines.104748/)

READ THESE RULES! No seriously, actually click the link and read the rules on that page.
Here are few I’d like to specifically direct your attention too.

**Powergaming:** 
•	Sprinting/Fighting as soon as you leave the hospital, or are revived by medics
•	Talking/Organizing while downed.

**Random Death Match(RDM):**
•	Attacking another player/group without any story/roleplay leading up to it.

You cannot honestly say you are giving quality Role Play if you return within the hour at 100% health/ability to get revenge after having lost a conflict. You are trying to re-roll the dice in your favor when you’ve already lost. Have a plan B, have a character B, but do not take your “loss” out on your fellow roleplayers.


“Story/RP leading up to it” means the OTHER person you are attacking should have a good understanding of why they are being attacked.

Think about this. Your character is ACTIVELY MURDERING SOMEONE. If you don’t have a VERY good reason as to why… again, you need to re-asses your Role Play.

-----

**Regarding “fear of reporting”**

This is absolute bullshit. If you have an issue with someone in the community, reach out and communicate like an adult. Letting your chat communicate for you is a downright lazy/toxic way to try and get your point across

If you don’t feel like you can’t have a civil discussion, that’s what the mods/staff/admins/trust is there for.

I have not ONE SINGLE time been reached out to regarding my RP or in character actions. My door is, and has always been open for discussion.

-----

I may be completely wrong regarding all of this, and I’m fully willing to admit if that is the case

I feel that we as a community should be building each other up and supporting one another, rather than fighting over views/subs

I know it’s nice to have that record sub/view count now, but I can assure you, if we keep heading the way we are now we will ALL lose out in the end. After all, rising tides raise all ships

It’s my genuine hope that I am not alone in these thoughts, and that other members of the community will step up and voice their opinion. If I am way off target here, and the MAJORITY of people INSIDE the RP community feel different, then I will gladly step down from the trust and keep my mouth shut. 

My goal has always been to help make this community, IN IT’S ENTIRETY, a better place. 

We can do better, we should do better, and if we don’t we are all heading for a big crash… and sooner than you think.

*In May 1990, the Border Security Force intercepted a marriage party. The bus was fired upon without any reason and looted. One person was killed. The bride Mubina Ghani and her chaperone aunt were separated from others, taken into the fields and gang-raped. It should have shocked everybody, but barring the incident forcing a change in Kashmiri marriages, nothing changed. The entire incident was subdued. Many years later it was revealed that after failing to hush it up, a court martial by the BSF sentenced two constables to only five years imprisonment and dismissal from service, while two head constables were given a mere punishment of forfeiture of seniority and reduction in rank.* 





The replies to the post are disgustingly horrible too where one comment says that the rape is justified because the soldiers have a hard life as is and liberals should not oppose such acts. 



The only reason they are so hateful towards that poor woman is because she's a Muslim. It does not matter to them what all injustice she faced but just because she's a Muslim, she deserved all that came towards her. The gang rape of a bride and her aunt is justified because they are Muslim. The murder of a civilian, who came to enjoy a wedding, by soldiers is justified because he's a Muslim.

"Probably controversial opinion: the handling, characterisation and writing of Slaanesh gave some people an out to behave like conservative puritans and bigots under the guise of irony and has made writing Slaanesh problematic and complicated.",4,c4uckg,40kLore,https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/c4uckg/probably_controversial_opinion_the_handling/,201,"Before i get into this i understand a caveat is in order here: **please try not to feel personally slighted or that i am painting with a broad brush here.** I am simply trying to iterate a specific sort of behaviour that i seein the fanbase. I am not trying to say you, the individual, are doing this or that everyone here is taking the blame. This is just something i think deserves to be mentioned and dissected out loud.

____

It shouldn't be controversial to say that Slaanesh has... issues, with the way they were portrayed. From their earliest inception, Slaanesh and their accompanying cult took 'inspiration' (if i can call it that) from queer and especially, queer leather kink culture, in order to communicate for lack of a better word, unrestrained sexual perversion and twisted, evil decadence and vile excess. 

[It's quite well put in this essay here by queer writer Dorian Dawes, who describes the issues as such](https://medium.com/@RealDorianDawes/lets-talk-about-warhammer-40k-830b27686a6e)
______

> _Degeneracy is Slaanesh’s domain. A being of unfiltered sexuality, worshiped by succubi, queers, and kinksters. Androgyny and queer sexuality is lumped in with sadomasochism, rape, and sexual abuse._

> _Stories regarding Slaanesh and her cult typically involve beautiful women seducing faithful Imperial guards or Space Marines into their beds making them vulnerable to demonic possession. Sometimes her cultists are portrayed as being androgynous, lithe young men “trapping” otherwise straight and masculine men into an act of queerness._

> ***It’s gay panic for space operas.***
____

You can disagree wheter or not the afforementioned scenarios happen as much as we think, but i think it's undeniable that, even if not in the lore but definatley within the fandom at large, that there's this certain unfortunate way that Slaanesh and their cult are portrayed.

You see it from the characterisation and depiction of Slaanesh as genderfluid and intersex, appearing at will in either male, feminine, androgyne or transgender forms, to the point where it's become a 'joke' in the fandom to draw Slaanesh with an obvious bulge. 

See for example, in TTS where Magnus wonderfully reffers to Slaanesh s 'he.... she.... it?'. Needless to say as a trans person i was uncomfortable with this, despite my love of TTS as a comedy show. It was the first sort of taste i got as a WH40k fan that the way fans envisioned queerness and transness was colored by a very specific meme and even bigotry that was masked and cloaked behind a veil of comedic irony. Comedic irony i myself engaged with as well, joking about with friends about wanting to bang a Keeper of Secrets. 

Moreover the connections were then made, within the fandom, to apply this sort of characterisation to anything outside of the heterosexual norm and binary, often under the guise of irony.

But i can tell you, as a trans and queer person, seeing some refer to 'traps' as 'heretical' and then follow that up by saying 'furries need to be purged' doesn't really come off as comedic ironic space xenophobia, when the targets are actual people who still suffer harm and societal demonisation for their percieved perversity and 'degeneracy', a word that has seen renewed popularity among certain segments of the population to use as a quick shorthand for everything not heterosexual or within the conventions of gender and gender expression.

It's then little wonder why these same sort of people will latch onto using this rhetoric at every turn to further ostracise people they already see as depraved. And that is the result of Slaanesh very deeply being queer-coded from the start.

**Associating transness and crossdressing with the God of Rape is deeply unsettling**, and it's something that i fear talking about lest i be seen as some sort of busybody who's rocking the boat too much. I really wish it wasn't this way but anytime someone mentions 'traps' in /r/Grimdank  i know which way the conversation is going to go. My body, my identity and my sex life, will be immediately connected to a malignant force of sexual violence and perversion. 


And i _have_ seen this sort of behaviour, just a few days ago i had someone told me that kinky sex in general was probably within the the realm of Slaanesh, which i think is an unfortunate demonisation of kink as a practice. One went even further to say that _anal sex in general_ would be seen as Slaaneshi excess.

See what i mean when i say that there's this certain framing that facilitated a noticeable culture of Puritansm cloaked in satire? 

The Imperium _is_ meant to be Puritanical, it is a heavily repressed society and culture that, with sudden kneejerks, reacts to anything slightly out of the ordinary as worthy of death, but for some people this nicely translated into bigotries and assumptions they might not eve be aware of, concealed beyond layers of irony that enables them to escape consequence or any deeper thought on it.

Certainly some people joking about this aren't really aware of the implications, but that's the form and functions of a society that subtly inculcates these things into people from a very young age

Slaanesh _shouldn't_ be associated with queerness, and not even kink for that matter because it's very honestly harmful, and _has_ been harmful. 

Every queer fan of WH40k that i personally know (and you'd be surprised at the ammount) feels it too. We obviously can't speak for everyone but it's a pervasive feeling at least among a decent number of people and i think that deserves consideration.

___

**Moreover it's made writing Slaanesh all the more difficult**, as it's become nigh impossible to untangle from the groundwork that's been laid, despite GW's best efforts to focus on Slaanesh as not being wholly around sex but merely hedonistic excess that can be applied to anything. Violence, artistic and musical ambition, pleasureable non-sexual excess (Noise Marines as an example) and drive, greed for wealth or power, and yes, sex and sexual violence as well.

I'm not personally completely opposed to having the sexual element be there, as sex is absolutely a vector of power and violence that people deal with and have dealt with, both in history and in our lives today. 

I believe good Slaanesh writing can be done without resorting to negative queercoding, or rather, i wish people would do more of it. 

Many serial killers were motivated by sexual desire, and the simple act of murder was sexually gratifying for many. People like Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy Jr. 

As an example of something similar done right i think, look to *Hellraiser*, written by a kinky gay man. The horrifying element there wasn't neccesarily the 'queerness' of the cenobites, but the fact that to them, the division of pain and pleasure was entirely blurred, and it wasn't the act of kink or BDSM that was bad, but to seek it at the cost of other people and even yourself that brought the Cenobites to the human dimension.

I think you _can_ add sexual violence in an important and communicative way into the mix, but it desperately needs to be tempered with better treatment of queerness and kink, something deeply and problematically embedded into Slaanesh from the start.",1561405589.0,Enleat,True,False,False,0.51,4,93784

I dislike entled behavior soooo much. But... I'm getting worried that any assertive or dominant behavior in a woman is getting demonized. These analogies put forth, eg, on the latest ask Reddit page, are behaviors that people are much more permissive of in men. Eg- ask for the manager. 

1) it is unlikely Karen would ask for the manager if she were... I dunno.. Phil, because the worker will scramble if Phil is annoyed. 


2) If Phil asks for the manager, the next words will be ""I'm sorry, sir""

3) His issue won't dismissed as petty, even if it is


I have seen people avoid asking for anything fixed, eg, missing food or the wrong meal, for fear of seeming like a ""Karen"". That is a disservice to the server and the restaurant because this winds up being potentially reflected in a tip without a chance to fix it.


It's hard enough to be taken seriously, and now... 

I worry that any assertive behavior is getting lumped into ""Karen"". I saw a video that made me ask if I am one. I only recently grew a spine after a lifetime of being abused in one way or another. I try to keep my spine, but I know that psychologically, people dislike overweight people etc, so the moment I am assertive- with a higher pitched voice, with my weight, they probably roll their eyes and dismiss me. 

It's so easy to just lapse into being as little a bother as possible, even when it's literally someone's job to bother. And they did it wrong in a way that means I have paid for food I can't eat because it will make my mouth break out in blisters  :(

Buying Fallout First But For the Right Reasons?,16,dod42m,fo76,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dod42m/buying_fallout_first_but_for_the_right_reasons/,162,"This may or may not get annihilated into oblivion but I feel the need to say this. 

There is all the hate going on right nowsaying like we have been lied to by Bethesda, that buying First is going to destroy the industry, etc. We’ve all heard it. 

Well before this announcement I was already casually throwing about $10 into the game once a month give or take. What if instead of paying for 76 because I’m a trash person that proves that Bethesda is evil, I wanted to pay ~$8 a month for $15 worth of Atoms, and coincidentally also got infinite scrap space, my favorite outfit in all of Fallout history, a second fast travel location, and servers that I could just play with my friends and didn’t have to deal with level 30’s tagging the Scorchbeast queen only to contribute nothing to her scaling difficulty?

What if I already enjoyed playing 76 all this time because it itches all the right scratches for me and supporting them with a relatively low monthly fee (I can’t even say I don’t spend more monthly on a gym membership I barely touch...)  so that the video game company running this game can KEEP THE LIGHTS ON for all the people screaming that back in the day you only paid for a game once but that refuse to pay again (that’s fine you don’t have to) but want eternal content updates for free. 

At the end of the day, people like being paid wages for the work they do and Bethesda does this crazy program where they need to pay their employees these wages for the work they do. If they don’t find ways to minimally harm the actual game while monetizing certain things that, realistically, cost them more money to develop, then the company can’t keep funding the developers and instead of having private servers that don’t affect the current game in literally any way that everyone still gets to use, we will have NO game to play, free or not. 

TL;DR
Don’t fault players that enjoy 76 for supporting the developers by buying First because we’re keeping the lights on for all the people that don’t pay.

Kakaos hypocrisy and my story of getting banned,0,bt6ww3,blackdesertonline,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonline/comments/bt6ww3/kakaos_hypocrisy_and_my_story_of_getting_banned/,216,"Hello Reddit,

I have been playing this Game for years now under the name Contash.

There has been a lot of uproar around me.

The rumors might or might not be true.

But this Thread is not about the controversy surrounding me,

it's about the way the Black Desert GMs handle bans.

There has been a lot of dispute around this topic as well.

Not long ago a whole guild was being threatened to get banned

because of an impostor on a Discord.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonline/comments/aysawp/control\_your\_cms\_and\_gms\_on\_your\_official\_discord/](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonline/comments/aysawp/control_your_cms_and_gms_on_your_official_discord/)

Also there were ban waves where a significant part of the punished people were innocent.

[https://community.blackdesertonline.com/index.php?threads/banwave-update-on-follow-up-measures.428601/](https://community.blackdesertonline.com/index.php?threads/banwave-update-on-follow-up-measures.428601/)

One might think they would change the way they handle bans,

after so many falsely accused players.

Now here is what happened to me:

First they suspended my account and told me that my account details might be compromised and asked for my ID card.

[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/509766369420509194/581225286398509125/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/509766369420509194/581225286398509125/unknown.png)

So I instantly fulfilled their request.

I didn't get any official message from their support,

not even confirmation of verification.

It took them a week to give me any information.

Which then was completely unrelated to the first Ticket.

[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/509766369420509194/581225604725211157/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/509766369420509194/581225604725211157/unknown.png)

12.1.5. I never ddos'd anyone, I never spammed and I never denied anyone any services,

except if openworld pvp falls under that term.

So does that mean, that anyone who enjoys pvp (which is an aspect of the game) can get banned now?

12.1.6. As many other players I am using Exit Lag it is a VPN, which even get's advertised by their Twitch Partners.

Yet using a VPN is also my right, as an EU Citizen to protect my self online.

Despite that, most Guildmaster Accounts get played by multiple people, even on stream , some people logon for friends for daily rewards when they are on vacation and the list goes on.

I am not saying it's wrong, but why would they enforce this rule only when they see fit.

[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/487439383742644224/582142354606129167/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/487439383742644224/582142354606129167/unknown.png)

Should I feel like this is fair towards me or is it a personal attack ?

If someone uses your in game name on another application and acts like a fool , can they threaten you

In game ? and your whole guild ?

I got banned, because they can ban you and anyone they want to, whenever they see fit.

Using article 12 which is ambiguous and can be interpreted however they want.

You ask me for my availability after you fired me?,25,gawapp,IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/gawapp/you_ask_me_for_my_availability_after_you_fired_me/,71,"Hi guys. Long time creeper (through this and other accounts). First time poster. On mobile. Awful when typing on my phone. 

Anyway. I worked as a photographer in the postpartum unit at a couple local hospitals, taking photos of newborns. Due to COVID-19, the company opted to terminate most of us so we could file for unemployment. Letter we received made it clear they were willing to rehire us. In addition, they sent out a follow up email with clarifications, including a bit about letting us know when rehire opportunities would be available. 

Two days ago I received an email asking for my availability for May since my state is starting to open up. They didn’t rehire me, never even let me know that they were giving people the option and already expected me to give them my schedule. 

Told them in a polite way they never let me know that rehire opportunities were available and that as far as I am aware, I’m not employed with them so I better be taken off the list of emails sent to employees and I have no plans to return. 

For some reason I feel like they didn’t actually fire me. It was hourly or commission, whichever paid more. But I have received money from them still since I was fired. Theoretically, if I was fired, I shouldn’t be receiving any money, even if it is commission. 

Either way, I don’t work there. Got school, a puppy, and freelance to worry about now 👋

EDIT: they fired me and tons of others. In the letter and following emails they said they would give us notice when they would be able to rehire us but we would need to reapply. By asking my availability they either did something without my knowledge or asked by mistake. I was laid off, full stop. I was NOT rehired at any point. I was not told at any point they were rehiring. 

I get it. People need jobs. I don’t though. So they can hire someone who does. 

As for unemployment, I didn’t even make enough working for them to qualify. I made less than $1300 within 8 months but can get that and more in two weeks with different commissions.",1588255585.0,not_quite_throwaway,True,False,False,0.52,25,656482

WARNING: Bungie have gone back on their advertised promise to credit extra season pass purchases. You will NOT receive Silver.,242,dysunk,DestinyTheGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dysunk/warning_bungie_have_gone_back_on_their_advertised/,346,"There’s a lot of misinformation and confusion in the comments (and people getting hung up on irrelevant details) so let me rewrite this post to be easier to follow. 

TLDR Bungie offered a pro-consumer thing, then deleted it without telling anyone.


1. Shadowkeep came out October 1st. Until mid-October, the Bungie store said this about season passes-

&gt; *Season Pass redeemed when logging in. If players already own the current Season Pass, they will receive credit toward future Seasons up until Season 11. Any credits beyond Season 11 will be exchanged for an equivalent value of Silver.


https://web.archive.org/web/20190808082916/https://bungiestore.com/products/destiny-2-shadowkeep

Please note that the asterisk applies to the season pass for both standard AND deluxe editions. 

This wording has been deleted from the current version of the page, but the references to preordering for the twintail fox skin etc still remain.

Bungie was offering this service until at least October 10th, so it was not a preorder only policy. You can see in this post on the 10th a Bungie support rep offering it to a player who hasn’t bought Shadowkeep yet.


https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/253880307

2. However, at some point, Bungie reworded the Steam/Xbox/PS4 store page to its current state, removing our ability to get Silver as credit for extra season passes.

&gt;* NOTE: A second Shadowkeep Digital Deluxe purchase does not grant additional Seasons or Silver. If you’re purchasing Shadowkeep on a second platform, please select the Standard Edition.


3. Bungie never alerted customers that they were changing this policy, so this lead to many customers over the past month applying for and getting denied Silver on the Bungie support forum. 

My intention for making this post was to alert other people who, like myself, didn’t know that the “Silver credit” offer was quietly cancelled without players being informed. 

To everyone who politely engaged in discourse in this thread, thank you and have a nice day. To the people who insulted and berated me while not actually understanding the situation, I hope you have a nice day too. Maybe the next time Bungie changes something you enjoy you’ll understand what it’s like 🤷‍♂️",1574205986.0,mrwafu,True,False,False,0.57,242,1491786

Here’s how one random Level 359 player with 1100 hours in game is using his/her FO1st Membership... tl;dr,42,doih0w,fo76,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/doih0w/heres_how_one_random_level_359_player_with_1100/,116,"This post isn’t to argue for the subscription or against it. My opinion is rather dry when it comes to that. It’s a frighin’ video game. No reason to get anyone’s panties in a bunch over anything regarding it. But that’s just me. 

Is it pay to win? Yeah, I guess so. It certainly isn’t just cosmetic. But before purchasing my 1 year subscription, I was already very high level with over 1k hours in game. Not to boast (in fact, admitting to having that many hours invested into ANY video game is nothing to be proud of), but I kind of feel like I’ve already “won” in the game by achieving that level, being properly equipped for any fight, and have more caps and 3*** Legendaries than I know what to do with. 

But I digress....I wanted to share what I have been using them membership for thus far. 

I enter a “Private World”. I launch a nuke over Whitesprings. I kill all ghouls without having to be butt buddies with everyone else that normally floods Nuke zones. I legendary farm. While doing so, I reach out to a Level 27 that posted that he was looking for some help/guidance. He invites his similarly leveled friend and we all enter a private world. I launch a nuke, and kill maybe 5 ghouls total. The rest, I assist in moving the hoard, and letting the n00bs get the full kills. I don’t half way kill them, as they will never learn if you do the job for them. I just get the ghouls to spawn and get them riled up, then jump to a place of safety so the n00bs can XP farm and even pickup a legendary or 2. 

One of the n00bs died about 10+ times, but he didn’t give up. I was a little proud. 

When I was level 30, a Level 200 took me under his wing and showed me how to camp build without looking like an idiot with Lincoln Logs. He told me to “Pay it forward” when I was high level. That’s exactly what I’m doing and told the n00b the same thing. 

The FO1st Private Servers are certainly flawed, but they still are great platforms for teaching, quietly camp building, farming, and anything else your heart desires without the large lobby barrage that can often occur in full servers. 

And on a final note, the Robotic dance emote is fucking hilarious. That alone is worth a hundred bucks. 

Don’t agree? Don’t care. I like the stupid subscription thing. So sue me.",1572310417.0,PRL867,True,False,False,0.53,42,247088

I find the current state of the community just unbelievable,10,bs14fa,thedivision,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/bs14fa/i_find_the_current_state_of_the_community_just/,154,"Why is everyone acting as if the game is bad or that they paid money and didn't get a product? Everyone of you nagging about the game has probably at least 100 hours in it and you're talking as if Ubi and Massive are leaving the game behind and pretending it's fine. Well they're not, they're working on everything, listening to the community but for some reason you're expecting everything to play out fine and great in 1 day. Too much negativity around, let's be a bit more positive. It's okay to report that you have issues, to post some suggestions (honestly my favorite posts here), but ""I'm leaving"" and ""the devs need to get their shit together"" posts are useless, meaningless, time-wasting  and pathetic. The devs have shown and said before that they're lurking around so let's be positive, have patience, *I BEG YOU GUYS*, let's be a good community so both we and the devs can make the Division even greater.

I'm sorry if I sound salty or if I offended anyone but it's so painful to see this treatment to a game with so much potential. Posting negativity is no different than stabbing ourselves in the back. Let's have some faith and keep in mind the comeback in endgame that other Ubi games and especially TD1 made in the past.

Edit: many seem to have misunderstood. I don't want anyone to stop talking, on the contrary, I want more posts, just not negative posts that lead to nowhere and people going around talking shit about the devs. That's all.",1558606289.0,ceciladams85,True,False,False,0.51,10,338614
Apparently #RefundWarren trending on twitter?!,11,eohl8v,ElizabethWarren,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/eohl8v/apparently_refundwarren_trending_on_twitter/,336,"What the actual hell is going on here?! Warren responded in the classiest most respectful way she could trying to move past these issues and now people are trying to get the word out on how to refund peoples donations?! SERIOUSLY?! 

My god this is even worse than the email scandal that Hillary went through. Back then we didn’t even know if she did something (obviously we found out later she didn’t) but now it’s obvious Warren didn’t do anything wrong and SHE’S the one being attacked?

I hope it’s proven these hashtags are all bots for Bernie Sanders or something trying to sow division.

EDIT: Wow I can’t believe I got gold! Thank you guys.

Also I’m muting the responses to this thread but I just wanna say one thing: Everyone, whether they’re a Bernie supporter or a Warren supporter, should not be jumping to conclusions. Correlation is not causation and we don’t know all the facts. Just because it seems 100% likely Warren’s campaign leaked this does not mean they did. 

Unfortunately we live in a culture where if something LOOKS like the reason, people automatically say it’s the reason. I don’t know who leaked this story whether it was a rogue Warren campaigner or someone who overheard it or whatever, but unless we know all the facts, pretending like you do will just make you look like a fucking idiot when the truth does come out.

So please be nice to people, even if you do think Warren leaked these things, try not to force your beliefs on others please 😊",1578983669.0,carissadraws,True,False,False,0.51,11,30329

Legacy Coalition holds no ill will towards the Smaller alliances of Winter Coalition. Alliances like ATF, Vindi, Lorde etc. This also includes the Chinese corps and alliances within Winterco that would like to chose a new leader. We bear no ill will to the Chinese community despite what Fraternity would tell you.

With the recent admission by Fraternities leader that Detroid can and likely will be lost this is us offering a hand of redemption. We have no intentions for more space, we do not want Wicked Creek, or Scalding Pass or Cache. There is some desire by allies of Legacy for Detroid and some of Insmother. But even that, without the main enemies of Legacy, we would be fine to see you fight over. We would love to see you all develop and grow.

Our conditions are simple. You can continue to work with Fraternity and retain your honour. But you must let us know you would like to persist upon their demise or we will assume you will need to be purged with them. You will have one week to inform me by evemail on the character Vily. We intend to clear if possible every Fraternity structure and Sov strucutre in the south of EVE. Once the purge has been completed as long as you do not work in any with NORAUS, ELO KNIGHT, WIND SPIRITS, FRATERNITY ALLIANCE, SNUFF BOX, and CURE ALLIANCE we will treat you much the same as we would Providence or any other neutral entity.

I received a ton of hate for being insane, creepy, overreacting, saying I was sexualizing innocent things and being a complete nuts. I also received a ton of private messages agreeing with me and telling me to look further. I'm glad I listened to the second and went with my gut.

On the advice of another redditor I went and looked at his computer to see if I could find anything or log into the game itself to show my parents. Well, I found a lot worse. There were a lot of images (drawn) of little girls, starting off first in the ""innocent"" type outfits I linked in the other thread, sexy posing then progressing to downright sick and ILLEGAL shit (nudity and hardcore sex). The cops were called and they said what he was doing was standard grooming type stuff and I did the right thing. They're bringing him in for questioning and also have taken the contents of his computer which they too confirmed was illegal

Maybe this seems silly to update this but I want anyone who read what I was told last night not to doubt themselves or their instinct when they get into a situation like that based on the opinion of uninvolved people. I just KNEW that something more was up. There was a feeling in the air and the look on his face. Please do not doubt your emotions when in comes to matter like this

**EDIT:** Quite a few people are screaming fake over the fact police were involved so fast. All I have to say is that I hope you're speaking from lack of knowledge and that isn't the case where you live but here if you call them over a serious matter they will send somebody out in minutes. ALSO it was not some dramatic thing with the police busting down doors, hunting him down, and hauling off his computer all at once. They detective looked at his computer first then they phoned him in and he agreed to come along.

""WAAAHHHH I'm bored"" - How much content do you think an independent studio can put out? I'm not sure if this is everybody's first rodeo, but every mmo-like game suffers from this problem. The hardcore fanbase will ALWAYS consume content much faster than it can be created. Try taking a break, and coming back when enough content has been released for you to stop bitching for a week or two.

""They put all their resources into eververse"" - This is dumb. 3d modelers, coders, level designers, ect are all different jobs. Less eververse items does not mean more content, it just means wasted payroll hours.

""Ritual weapons suck"" - Yeah, then maybe you shouldn't have bitched nonstop about pinnacle weapons being OP and calling for nerfs.

""Bungo can't fix a bug"" - They can, but then you'll complain about a lack of content if they shift their resources to address these quicker. Destiny 2 is an expansive game, with tons of different content. Have you hunted bugs before? If it was straightforward, they woudn't exist in the first place.

I strongly urge people to research off msm and see that joe is actually right about hospitals being empty,  many deaths are being registered as covid when they are not, doctors posting videos on big tech social media with different opinions than the msm is narrative are being censored, importance of keeping your immune system up

None of this matters, her tone changes and now it seems like I have a red dot on my head. She says she doesn't understand why libertarians can't just be democrats. I tell her I have a degree in economics and that some of these issues aren't as clear and simple as she might make them out to be.

I still thought perhaps the night could still be salvaged, but no sir. Icing on the cake is we both understand the night is over, and I go to at least give her a hug goodbye and she puts her hands up making pushing away gestures lol

Unrealistic Expectations,4,e6gsyi,DestinyTheGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/e6gsyi/unrealistic_expectations/,97,"I’ll most likely get downvoted to hell for saying this but here we go. 

This subreddit has always been a bit toxic but for the past day or so I will scroll through here and only see negativity and toxicity. Have any of you considered the possibility that you set your expectations...

Way too high?

Like with trails, Bungie never said anything about it coming this season but you complain as if they promised us it would be included. 

When Bungie split with Activision it meant that yes they were free from their constraints, but they did lose funding and other resources, additionally the devs have said they felt overworked last year. 

You are literally expecting them to develop just as much content as before even though they have less resources and aim to not overwork their employees. It just doesn’t work.

This is the new normal, and if you don’t like it well then no one is forcing you to pay or play. 

Now I’m not saying that Bungie hasn’t made bad decisions or that this season will be perfect. There will always be things to complain about, but if you continue to expect so much content for a $10 season then you need a reality check. 

And as a side note, that ties in with unrealistic expectations, is the complaining itself. Simply complaining achieves nothing other than putting people down and creating toxicity. Constructive criticism on the other hand, is far more helpful. It is completely fine to point out flaws or issues, that’s how you improve. But after pointing it out, provide a solution or attempt to understand things from Bungie perspective.

This was kinda just a rant. I love this community so dearly but this kind of toxicity is just wrong. 

Let’s just take this season one step at a time, and before we complain, let’s step back and adjust our expectations. Bungie makes a lot of mistakes, but quite a number of them are simply the community exaggerating issues beyond what they are and expecting things that aren’t realistic. 

Anyway, love y’all

"Because of all of today's discourse, I decided to actually research the original quotes that people are referencing. Here are my findings.",53,dw2ojf,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/dw2ojf/because_of_all_of_todays_discourse_i_decided_to/,126,"Hi all, I'm really getting annoyed by the more... toxic side of the fanbase. I don't post on this subreddit often, but I felt like this would be the most appropriate place to post this for visibility. Strap in, because this'll be a long one.

 So, after seeing all the discourse today on Twitter about #gamefreaklied, I thought maybe people were taking things a liiitle too far, but besides that I realized that everyone's been pulling the ""Brand-New Models"" and ""High Quality Animations"" cards since those stories broke and maaaybe the original message was lost in the rhetoric. So I decided to go back to the original sources of each quote and actually determine whether or not they were

1. even quoted correctly

and

2. actually lies.

So let's start with the ""rebuilt the models from scratch"" stuff. Upon searching it up, I found [this Polygon article](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/2019/7/13/20693069/pokemon-sword-shield-pokedex-limited-game-freak-statement-nintendo-switch), which cites [this NintendoEverything article](https://nintendoeverything.com/game-freak-elaborates-on-pokemon-sword-shields-inability-to-bring-in-pokemon-not-in-the-galar-pokedex-pokemon-home-more/), which cites [this Silliconera translation](https://www.siliconera.com/2019/06/16/game-freak-says-it-will-be-hard-for-all-pokemon-to-appear-even-in-games-after-pokemon-sword-shield/) of [this Famitsu interview](https://www.famitsu.com/news/201906/13177936.html). 

That’s already a lot of hoops to get though for an actual sauce, but I read through all of them to compare (and what I could of the original interview, but I’m disregarding that because Google Translate is hella spotty). The Silliconera translation and NE article are pretty much the same, but the Polygon article is slightly different. I mean, it makes sense that you would probably want to mix things around a bit to seem like you’re not just repeating the story over again. The BIG problem with this, is that in this instance, sites kept citing other sites, and self-perpetuated the rumor. Want to know where that “rebuilding all the models from scratch” line came from? Me too, because it sure wasn’t from the original interview they’re all citing. Here is the excerpt from Silliconera:

	_ “According to Ohmori, even in Pokemon Sun & Moon, bringing in every Pokemon was something barely manageable, and with Pokemon Sword & Shield and the need to redo models, and so they had to make a decision. However, Ohmori says that despite this, the Wild Areas and story will have quite a bit of content to make up for it.”_

That’s it. That’s the only mention of models throughout the entire translation.

Did they ever say they needed to redo them from scratch? Nope.

Where did it come from then?

Well, we have a daisy chain of events.

1. Silliconera, as far as I can tell, was the first to report on this interview (Not sure if they were the translators but they are the farthest back in this citation chain).

2. NintendoEverything, cites SE, is mostly the same but simplifies a few of the topics into bullet points. The most important part of this is that they put “With Pokemon Sword/Shield and the need to redo models, they had to make a decision” as its own bullet point.
3. Polygon then cites the NE article (and also [this reddit post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/cb2z26/japanese_interview_from_famitsu_reveals_all_old/), which I’ll get to in a bit.), but what’s important here is their headline. It reads:

##No, Pokemon Sword and Shield is not reusing models from recent Pokemon games
#All models were remade from scratch, says Game Freak

So, there’s a big problem with this: they _literally never said that_.  I don’t know if this was supposed to be clickbait or whatever, but that title is straight up false. That doesn’t matter though, because other news sites ATE. IT. UP.

[Newsweek]( https://www.newsweek.com/pokemon-sword-shield-models-controversy-1449299)

[IGN]( https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/14/pokemon-sword-and-shield-arent-recycling-3d-models-game-freak-confirms)

[vg247]( https://www.vg247.com/2019/07/14/pokemon-models-pokemon-sword-shield-brand-new/)

[Eurogamer]( https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-07-14-game-freak-isnt-recycling-3ds-models-in-pokemon-sword-and-shield-after-all)

They ALL reference Polygon. 

They also reference that reddit post I mentioned, but that just cites the NintendoEverything article, with the exception of the first paragraph, which is by the OP of the post. It reads:

""_UPDATE: Holy Arceus this blew up. Really didn't think this would reach so many people to thousands of Twitter retweets and even a Polygon article. The best way to explain all the questions is with a full explaination. Obviously everything stated in the article is not my own words so let's focus on the intro paragraph of my own. The whole reason I researched this topic in the first place was due to listening to an episode of Comicbook.com's Pokemon podcast (Episode 10 around the 40 minute mark) about a Japanese magazine interview. Most of the information from my paragraph was lifted from that including the mention of framerates and quality, the line about starting from scratch, and about Dynamax models. Also, Gamefreak has gone on record that they have 2 development teams, Team A is Town, B is Pokemon. Obviously no one really knows if this is true until we have the game in our hands and search the game files._

_When they switched over from 3DS to Nintendo Switch, the framerates and quality were both different. In this article they reveal that when they went to transfer models and move animations into SS they didn't transfer over right forcing them to rebuild them by scratch. Keep in mind Game Freak only has 143 employees, only half of which are working on Pokemon, the other half on Town. So basically while the same animations of the Pokemon themselves are copied and pasted, most if not all Pokemon models had to be redone. On top of that issue, Dynamaxing forces Gamefreak to produce extra models for each and every Pokemon, because you can't just take the same model and increase it's size by 10 and expect it to look even half decent_.”

So, their only source for that info was the 10th episode of Comicbook.com’s Pokemon Podcast. See, the funny thing about that is that I actually tried to find it to see what the original quote was and what they sourced, but when I checked their YT channel it literally just went from ep. 9 to ep. 11. [Here’s a screenshot.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/552969201891934221/644281484060131369/unknown.png) Dunno if they unlisted it for some reason, but it still means I can’t actually cite what they actually said. 

**Anyways, the main takeaway from this is that Polygon’s faulty reporting gave us the “we remade the models from scratch” line, no one ever actually said it. Considering people have been pedaling that one for months, I’d say that’s a pretty big find.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ANYWAYS, let’s move on to everyone’s favorite: “high quality animations”. My point in this section is to show that the line was taken out of context and reworded unintentionally to sound like they sacrificed pokemon for higher-quality animations. I’m going to indicate now that my findings indicate that this misquote got traction because not enough people bothered to read anything but the “title” (I’ll elaborate in a moment).

So, for this quote, the main article sourced was [this USGamer interview](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/pokemon-sword-and-shield-interview). It’s a fairly standard interview. It was cited by all the news outlets that reported on it, but what did they actually say in it?

Well, the only actual mention of animations is in this paragraph:

	_” There are a couple of different parts to the thinking behind it, but really the biggest reason for it is just the sheer number of Pokemon. We already have well over 800 Pokemon species, and there's going to be more added in these games. And now that they're on the Nintendo Switch, we're creating it with much higher fidelity with higher quality animations. But even more than that, it's coming down to the battle system. We're making sure we can keep everything balanced and give all the Pokemon that appear in the games a chance to shine.”_

He says the reason for cuts was mostly based on the sheer amount of Pokemon. I mean, that seemed pretty obvious from the beginning. The rest of the paragraph is just fluff, if I’m being honest. They’re basically just saying “the game is on an HD console now, we have to make refinements”. Whether they did or not isn’t the point; the point is that nowhere in this interview did they say that Pokemon were sacrificed for better animations. They never made an excuse, or did any of the stuff people keep accusing them of. 
So where did the famous words come from? Well, when I was looking for that article I stumbled across [this video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAydd_b8Xlo), and many others like it (there are quite a few). What do they all have in common? They site [this tweet](https://twitter.com/serebiinet/status/1138878900421967872?lang=en) by Serebii, which reads:

_”Serebii Note: In an interview with @USgamernet, Junichi Masuda reaffirms that the sheer volume of high quality animations and desire to balance further resulted in the decision to block transfer of some Pokémon Interview”_

This is the “title” I was referring to earlier. People read this title without reading the article (pretty similar to the Polygon situation, now that I think about it), and immediately made their judgements. I definitely have reason to believe that this this tweet’s miswording snowballed into that famous catchphrase. It does make it sound worse than it is, and I really think they were just trying to fit it into Twitter’s character limit. Obviously no harm was meant by Serebii, it’s just an honest mistake. But those videos cited it, and the people watching those videos also probably wouldn’t have gone back to read the article because obviously no one’s got time for that (/s).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for reading that, hopefully it clears the air a bit. It only took a couple hours to research and write, and I hope it was worth it lol.

Stop trying to do difficulty levels that are too hard for your shitty build you slapped together 4 days after release. (Solo Heroic vids),0,ffcccc,thedivision,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/ffcccc/stop_trying_to_do_difficulty_levels_that_are_too/,72,"Firstly this is in regards to solo and duo play, I can't speak for 3+ player scaling as I haven't tested it, this post is for those saying the game is now ""not friendly to solos"".

I get it, I'm no expert either, but before Warlords I was running the shittest build ever because I HATED the gear system/UI but I could still do Challenging no worries, never ever having to use armor kits. Now I actually have to use them sometimes, which is quite novel. But after the truly excellent revamp of the gear systems/UI the joy for looting and making builds is back as it's easier than ever to put them together and improve them so there no excuses! Don't listen to the rubbish, most of this build comes from hard difficulty with recals from the clan vendor/Cassie or higher rolls from more hard difficulty content.

Anyway, here's some solo Heroic gameplay.

Here is me killing some mobs on a Heroic Control Point.

Here is the pretty average build used in these vids with LOADS of room for improvement.

[https://imgur.com/BJVKsgC](https://imgur.com/BJVKsgC)

This build is FAR from optimized, has no exotics or gear set pieces, doesn't rely on revive hive and is paired with the Firewall specialization where I only have 15 points put into SMG damage because I'm leveling the spec. You could switch to Survivalist for more survivability or pretty much anything else for more damage. The talent on the SMG doesn't even do anything with my playstyle and my mask gives me +pistol damage. I just focused on SMG dmg, crit chance, crit damage and headshot damage. I can do level 4 control points in a reasonable time and level 3 are quite easy. FYI level 3 control points can DEFINITELY drop decently rolled gear as well as blue prints.

Once you move into Challenging and higher you actually have to think about some synergy in your build, you can't just expect to blitz the content only making sure you have weapon damage as your main stats. For instance the synergy in my build is the backpack talent Vigilance (25% extra weapon damage if you haven't taken damage for 4 seconds) paired with the Crusader shield, the shield takes damage, I don't, buff stays up. The shield still tanks some Heroic damage at only skill tier 1. For survivability I run Unbreakable (when your armor is depleted repair 95% of your armor, 60 sec CD) on the chest.

In the Invaded video it's also about using lines of sight properly, I try to keep some cover between me and the heavy while I pick off his buddies. I don't just stand there in the open in this cover based shooter. It's also about prioritizing targets, any healers or skill spammers need to go down as quick as possible and the tankiest enemies should be saved until last unless you can safely isolate them.

Also, if you're not having fun on the higher difficulties why are you playing them?! I got most of the gear I have from hard difficulty then collected a few great rolls from just doing more hard content for recal. Sure it's rare to get good gear or rolls in Hard but it's supposed to be that way, it's called progression. What would be the point of loot at all if you could get excellent gear and rolls in a few days?

TLDR; If you haven't put that much thought/effort/time into your build, stick with hard until you do. It's not about doing the hardest content immediately, there's supposed to be a progression journey and it's crazy to expect to have the best gear and be facerolling the hardest difficulties in the game less than a week after release.

Fat Instagram model gets a New Years Eve dose of reality.,0,gdgx8g,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/gdgx8g/fat_instagram_model_gets_a_new_years_eve_dose_of/,25,"In one of my circle of friends there is a large young lady that we will just call Mandy.  Mandy has her own Instagram page and she literally spends all of her free time taking semi naked pictures of her self and posting multiple pics and vids of herself every day.  Mandy has a pretty face and the curves of her body are not bad per say but to give you an idea of her girth she is 5'4"" and weighs a good 220 lbs.

Mandy used to be pretty down to earth and had what I thought was a really great personality.  After she hit 50 thousand followers on her Instagram account everything changed.  If you ask her what she does for a living she will tell you that she is either an ""Instagram model"" or an ""body positive influencer"" even though she has a full time job at a law office.  For the first time she started to say really douchey things like, ""oh I don't have time for things like such and such"" or  my fav ""I can't be seen in a place like this""

Ham Mandy put a lot of work into her Instagram pics over the holidays and she did this whole soft pornish shoot with a New years Eve theme apparently her thirsty followers started calling her the NYE Queen and this stuck in her head.  A big group of us including Mandy were going to really nice semi formal NYE Party in San Francisco and she got it in her fat head that she wanted to be crowned ""queen"" of the event.

I should probably back up a moment and mention that there is a current trend on Instagram where overweight girls create their own accounts, post semi nude pics and get compliments from all kinds of thirsty men.  The problem is when these fat women start to think that their little carbo bloated safe space is mirroring reality.  No joke thought, a lot of these fat Instagram models have huge egos to match their massive size!

So we all go to the ball and Mandy is making a fool out of herself from the beginning.  She is annoyed that nobody has offered to buy her a drink or pay her a compliment after being there for 10 minutes so she starts to approach the best looking men at the party.  All of them shoot her down and she makes it worse by saying things like, ""you just can't handle a REAL woman"".  I mean she really thought that every guy was going to be all over her and before she got his with a dose of reality she kept commenting on how ugly the other women at the party were.  You would think that after getting shot down she would have been humbled a bit but she was not done yet.  After a few drinks and an unattended MC microphone she outdid herself.  I kid you not, she grabbed the mic and said, ""WOOO HOOO, your New Years Queen is HEEERE"".  Security tried to nicely get her to stop but Mandy the ham was not having any of that.  She became really billigerant and got kicked out of the event.

All of us were tired of her so we did not rush to leave the event.  When we did finally leave an hour later Mandy was in a MacDonald's across the street.  It was like a scene out of a Rebel Wilson Romcom.  Here makeup was running down her face and she was STUFFING her face with a big mac and fries while sobbing.

"If you play PVE, masterwork your armor. PVP too. Just do it. 25% damage reduction is a good thing.",41,bvwyqz,DestinyTheGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/bvwyqz/if_you_play_pve_masterwork_your_armor_pvp_too/,242,"I found this video that explains masterworking armor.

**tldr to save watching a 10 min video** : having 5 pieces of armor gives 25% damage resistance, which is effectively 33% more health.

So set your nightfall card to Solar singe, then put on 5 pieces of solar masterworked armor.  The singe lets you do 25% more damage, but you also take 25% more from solar sources.  Masterworked armor effecticely means you do 25% more, but take no additional damage.  Now you increased your score multiplier, but there are zero negative effects heading your way.

Masterwork 3 pieces, one of each elemental type, and you get 5% damage reduction from all elemental sources.

Then when in your super, you get 1% per tier overall damage resistance.  So 5 masterworked pieces of armor means you get 25% more damage resistance during your super, and this is the only effect masterworked armor has in pvp, but its pretty huge.  The hunter using his super that seems unkillable, while you seem to die more easily using the same super, likely has all masterworked armo, and you don't.  he essentially has 33% more health than you do while in his super.

In pve its useful at all times AND while in your super.

I keep reading about people with hundreds of cores, and almost every time i find out they don't masterwork armor, and often only a few guns.  Orbs are a huge advantage.  Damage resistance is a huge advantage.  If you join my lfg to do a nightfall and have nothing masterworked, i consider you a liability, not an asset to the fireteam.  Id rather play with someone who has masterworks and is making orbs, vs someone who thinks just having thunderlord or whisper is going to carry them through.",1559479390.0,Delet3r,True,False,False,0.52,41,1491786
March 6 FI Confession- I feel cheated,3,ftoxl7,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ftoxl7/march_6_fi_confession_i_feel_cheated/,138,"47M - after years of planning and plotting, I announced my retirement the morning of February 21, effective March 6. As we all know, starting that day, the markets tanked and kept tanking, and that was obviously upsetting. I've got \~1.5 years cash in the bank, and depending on the day, we're down 30-40% putting us at lean-FIRE so I was annoyed,  but not too worried.

&#x200B;

But then everyone got the stay-at-home orders. Absolutely needed, yes, and I'm glad it happened...*BUT* this was supposed to be **my time** to be at home, **my time** to putter around in the yard or walk the neighborhood in the middle of the day, **my time** to day drink, **my time** to watch Netflix at 9:30 in the morning or play XBox while eating nachos for lunch.

Okay, I know that's probably selfish and the pinnacle of first-world problems, but I can't be alone feeling this way and I had to vent.

**EDIT for all the, ""Why do you care what others are doing think?!"" people:**

We bought our house after the 2008 crisis for around $250k, while it was valued around $400k ad had been on the market at one point at $600k, and it's one of the lower priced houses not just in our neighborhood, but also in the incorporated village we live in. Beautiful area, wonderful schools, amazing parks and services all around. About half of our neighbors are retired or own multiple businesses (pharmacies, jewelry stores, concrete or HVAC businesses, you get the idea), while I've always been someone who  worked for others. If I'm honest, I've always felt like a bit of an impostor, so, when I was able to FIRE, it was...*is* validation that I've ""made it"" and have been a success. 

""Why do you care?"" Because I'm fucking human, and anyone who says they truly don't care what others think is full of shit. So yeah, I care what others think, but now, I don't have to (as much) because I've proved to myself that we can fit in whatever the idea of status is now. 

""Why does it matter that everyone is home?!"" Because my neighbors do stuff during the day, and I was going to be able to join the crowd, and now I can't. Boo-hoo, I know. But that's the selfish reason, so there you go.

You wanna take credit for my work? You wanna tell me you hope my family dies? Want to try to fight me for winning-out against your bullshit? Ok how's losing your ability to work in this city and a few years in jail as well as public humiliation?,1422,c2oorl,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/c2oorl/you_wanna_take_credit_for_my_work_you_wanna_tell/,580,"We have to get a few details about me out of the way:   


Backstory TLDR: Do not fuck with me. I'm blunt and stubborn. Also I'm better at my job than you will ever be so just get over that now. Also I hate my career field. I work in tech but I'm not going to be more specific than that.  


A note on the stubborn-ness: I am the most stubborn, and blunt (rude if you push me) person you will ever meet. I expect everyone (Doubly so for management) to do the right thing even when no one is looking. One of the things I have learned is that narcissists and sociopaths cannot fucking stand me. They will actively melt down if they work with people like myself. Those people thrive when people have to 'be nice.' The exception to my stubborn bluntness? If you work under me. I help everyone working under me with everything they need 100% of the time and am super friendly unless they give me a reason not to be. I treat people under me (in terms of technical position and in the companies hierarchy) like royalty and the people beside and above me like ""You should be at least as competent as myself, no excuses.""   


Example: If you lie about me/to me? Well I had better be getting an open, and public apology (to the people who you lied to) with admission of guilt or I'm going to make you fucking regret it. Best not be treating anyone else below you bad either. Lots of managers have a problem with this for some reason. Don't want this to happen? Don't lie.  


Now with that said I have a constant wave of job opportunities. Every company I've ever worked for (including the one that fired me) begging to have me back at a higher pay rate than what I made when I worked there. Actually about 25% more than the highest pay in the country I live in. So I'm not in any position to care if someone is going to fire me.  


Now thats out of the way, at my current job I've worked here for about 2.5 years. I took this job because it was going to allow me to have the time off I wanted: About 35 days of PTO, and 10 weeks (first 2 unpaid) of vacation time. Its a long story but basically I need the time off. I was hired in at about 50% of the standard rate of pay for this reason. Contractually I can take this time off any time I want. I could, if I so desired, leave work mid day and go on vacation.  


When I first started the company laid off every other ""IT Guy"" after about a year aside from two. Those guys are mostly there to cover me leaving suddenly and if someone needs to pull something while I work on something else.  


My previous manager actually recommended me to manage the department but I didn't want to take it so the company gave me an open door to take said position any time I wanted and they would just demote anyone in said position. This is where Sociopath comes in: To manage.  


First day he pulls us all (My team + one more) into a meeting and talks about how hes a 'nice guy' but is going to drive us to work extra hard. This is where the first altercation occurs ""Yeah how is that the case? \[Other team\] is purely reactionary and our team has literally no issues inside the company and 100% of our work is completed at nearly 3 times the rate of any other business in the area?"" ""We will hold questions for private meetings."" ""Ok fair enough.""  


He pulls me in and the first thing out of his mouth is to yell at me: ""I never want you to question me ever again!"" I was honestly stunned. ""Excuse me?"" ""You will do what I say when I say! NOW GET OUT!""  


He wraps up the 'meeting' by saying ""I'm really glad to have gotten this job because I cannot leave this town due to the fact that I am obligated to watch my kids half of the year. So I can't wait to get to know all of you!""  


I immediately went to HR  as soon at the meeting was over and explained the situation. Thing is HR is the guy who hired me, and we like each other a lot. He tells me ""Ok, well, unfortunately it would be against company policy to fire him this quickly. Also I have to take his side of the story first.""  


He didn't 'yell' at me after I went and spoke to HR but called me in and said ""Listen, they are telling me to apologize to you and thats just not going to happen. I'm your boss its my right to treat you how I see fit. I didn't realize you were a rat, but now that I know that I'm afraid that I am going to be extra hard on you. Better do what I say or its your job!""  


 I replied ""Its not your job to yell at people and maybe you should understand that. If you were half as competent as you want to seem I don't think you would ever have a reason to yell at anyone. Also if reporting behavior that is against company policy makes me a rat, then being a rat must be a good thing."" He just yelled ""GET THE FUCK OUT!"" and pointed at the door. I replied ""I'm afraid I'm going to have to go to HR again about your behavior if you don't apologize now."" Which I did.  


The issue? Well I live in a one party state for recording conversations. So I recorded said conversation.  


Three weeks later and HR has decided to keep him on because we are still way ahead of everyone in terms of metrics. Since then my team and the other team has gone from loving their job to hating it. Everyone is reporting to me that he is screaming at them constantly but only in private. He doesn't even speak to me. The way he is treating the guys under me is what was really getting to me. They are HIS EMPLOYEES. He SHOULD NOT be treating them this way. I hate to use a quote from the office here but Micheal Scott is 100% correct: ""A manager is not here to hire and fire, but to lead and inspire.""  


Now we are supposed to have certain metrics passed down to us by management but he has 'decided against that' to 'keep morale up.' However I knew what he was up to. So I went to my friend in HR and didn't tell him that he wasn't sending me the metrics (which he is required to do as per company policy) and had him send me a copy of everyone's metrics early ""but keep it on the down low!""So he did.  


For several months I told my team and the people under me ""Just hold out on quitting he won't be here for long, trust me.""  


Slowly things between myself and him escalate. I make decisions that he doesn't like because ""You didn't run that past me first."" In reference to my vacations and days off. Contractually I don't have to do this and to be blunt I cant fucking stand him so hes just SOL when it comes to me not being there. This leads to several times of him trying to scream at me while I sat there and was 100% calm and patient but blunt and moving in my position that I can take leave when ever I want contractually and he is just going to have to get over that.  


One of the things I specifically remember him yelling at me the last time: ""You will do whatever I tell you when ever I tell you. If I throw a ball and say fetch you will fucking retrieve it. Do you understand?""   


At this point I lost my patients and said ""Are you done yet? Ok great you are going to listen to me now! You are hands down the worst manager I have ever worked under. You are unproductive, and the least competent. The other two guys metrics have been falling since you have been hired...""   


Him: ""Because your dumbass never listens to me. You are the problem here not me get out NNNNNNOOOOOOWWWW!""   


Me: ""Are you done? Because I think you are going to want to hear what I have to tell you! Your absolute childish behavior is unacceptable and I don't think that your supervisors or HR are going to appreciate how you have treated myself or this...""  


At this point he gets up, grabs the chair in which I'm sitting, and literally rolls it towards his door screaming ""I DON'T HAVE TO FUCKING LISTEN TO A DIP SHIT LIKE YOU! I'M THE BOSS DO WHAT YOU ARE TOLD!""  


I replied: ""I hope you know this can be considered assault and battery.""  


Him: ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" and he promptly rolls me out of the office.  


Now here is the thing: Before that meeting I said I wanted an HR rep to sit out side of the office and listen in. They said they couldn't do that but would place one in the meeting. He was late. He over heard he last SHUT THE FUCK UP! Just as he rolls me out into the hall. He then proceeded to look up, see HR and start sweating bullets.   


Him:""Oh...huhuh, I was... we were just joking around.""   


Looking up at him: ""No we weren't. He was just screaming at me and insulting me for no apparent reason.""  


He looks down at me hard and says: ""This team always jokes around! I mean it was just a joke!""  


I then pull out a small recorder and looked at HR and said ""Well given that you missed the meeting I think you should just review it here on this tape as this is ""just a joke"" apparently performance reviews are 'just a joke' around here now.""  


HR insists we go over the performance review. He pulls his copy out and begins going over the metrics on it talking about how bad of an employee I am. As soon as he finishes I look at the sheet of paper he is going over I pull the metrics that my buddy in HR sent me. ""No...No I'm afraid this is all wrong.""   


He looks at me ""I...I'm sorry.""   


Me: ""Oh yeah, \[buddy in HR\] sent me my metrics independent of what you sent me. In fact, and I can't believe you didn't know this, all of the metrics are review-able by any employee at any time if they make an inquiry. Actually you have failed to send us any metrics at all as is your job to do weekly.""  


The HR rep then looks at me ""Is that all?""  


Me: ""Yes.""  


HR Rep: ""Ok I think we are done here.""  


He requests that I stay, I look at him and reply: ""No, I'm afraid I'm done listening to anything you have to tell me. Afraid I have an appointment to review your behavior with HR.""  


So HR and myself review the tape and their jaws are on the floor. HR Buddy apologizes to me. They ask me what I think should happen as I was the one who was originally up for promotion. I explain that he should not only have to write a letter apologizing for his behavior in email form, but also apologize to all the teams under him in person at one time. Just after they send an email to him I drop by his office and say ""Hey man, don't worry. I didn't let them review that tape.""  


He sends an apology letter and tells me that ""You are on my good side now!""  


A few moments later HR comes down and tells him that its not enough and to have all the teams gather in front of him. In the mean time I rig up the conference room to have a typed letter of all the times he has yelled at every single person which took me all night to do.  


He comes in and makes some bullshit apology thats a non apology ""I'm sorry I was so hard on you guys. I just know your potential and....""   


I cut him off (HR isn't in the room) ""Excuse me? Thats not good enough! I'm afraid you are going to need to apologize for your actual behavior and not give an apology that sounds like ""I'm sorry I was trying to help you and you didn't like it."" No, I'm afraid you are going to need to actually apologize and admit to wrong doing and tell the actual truth!""  


At which point he visibly starts to get angry ""I...I AM APOLOGIZING!""   


Me: ""Ok go on""  


Him: \[More non apology with him being obviously fake upset.\]  


I press play on the slide show. ""Ok since you didn't get the message the first time we are going to go through these individually. On December 11 2001 you screamed at Robert Robbington where in you failed to give him a review and simply called him a dumbass."" I continue: ""You need to repeat these words exactly if you want to keep your job: ""Dear Mr. Rob, I apologize for being overtly hostile and rude. I apologize for failing at my responsibilities as a manager to both you and the team. I understand I have a problem with anger and am willing to seek help with my clear lack of empathy for other people. As such I will be signing a document admitting fault, under the circumstances that I ever hit you again I want everyone to know that I would be 100% at fault and you would not be, and proof of my misbehavior towards you as proof of my honesty in apologizing two witnesses will be signing this document.""  


As soon as I finish speaking he stands there and starts turning angrily red and says ""MrBurington, we need to speak alone. NOW!""   


I reply ""No, I'm afraid we don't. If you do not wish to apologize to Robert Robbington then you can apologize to me for this!""   


At which point I play the audio of him talking to me ""I really hope your \[family member\] dies. I mean really. I'm your boss and this is your job and you care about \[family member\]? You think I give a fuck about them or you? You could die for all I fucking care. When \[family\] dies if you mourn I'll be mocking you. I just want you to  know that. Now fuck off."" (You see after that little incident I couldn't have given a fuck if I did get fired I just wanted to ruin this guys life.)  


He immediately starts howling at me that I 'edited' the audio and runs to get HR. Shortly there after HR comes back and the entire room denies that any of this happened. We all instead go through with a plan I had from the beginning: I was going to expose him for the POS he was/is IF he does not honestly apologize and admit to actual wrong doing.  


HR then tells him hes fired. He storms off.  


Now this is where the hard core revenge part comes in. I used to work for every single IT Company in this town, or have connections to them somehow. Hell I trained at least half of the management at the last company I worked for. My words have weight. So I make calls to all of the places I have ins at which is literally everywhere in town telling them to black list this guy. However at two companies I request that if he applies I would like to show up and help them interview him. He applied to both jobs and I was sitting there in the meeting room ""Oh hey! Just wanted you to know that I knew Mr. Meet for years."" Middle of the interview I bring up his behavior with the audio from him telling me that he hopes my family member dies.   


I then tell my ex-manager: ""Also just note, you may want to write this down, all the tech jobs in our area will have a copy of this audio. So you can go ahead and explain to them why you told me this and they can relay that to me.""  


As soon as we get out into the parking lot he swings on me and starts screaming ""I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU. FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU."" I run back into the building and security detains him and calls the police (My buddy recorded this on his phone, as well as obtained a copy of the video from security)   


After a quick court case and going to jail he shows up at my house with a knife screaming ""I'M GOING TO FUCKING KILL YOU! RUIN MY CAREER JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE A BITCH."" (I think he had the address from working at the company with me)   


I called the police, got my gun, and explained the situation while I waited on the cops to show up. He proceeded to be detained and got sentenced to a 2 year stent in prison.

Neighbors tried to label me a prostitute because I was sexually active,0,ffa6m6,EntitledBitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledBitch/comments/ffa6m6/neighbors_tried_to_label_me_a_prostitute_because/,86," 

I lived in Melbourne, Australia for a bout a year (2013 to 2014). There, I met a gorgeous same sex couple - Brian and Derek ( name changed ). They were both bisexual. They lived in the same building as me on the floor directly above mine. I soon entered into a sexual relationship with both of them. We would have threesomes, and sometimes gangbangs. Besides the awesome sex, I also became really good friends with them and we're still in touch. It was tons of fun for all involved.

Among my neighbors, were a middle aged couple with two children. They lived right across the hallway from me and were quick to judge us after seeing Brian and Derek exiting my apartment early in the morning on more than one occasion. The woman, Karen asked me in the elevator what I was doing with ""those two gays"". I politely told her it was none of her business. When she kept on pestering me, I told her ""If you must know, I'm friends with benefits with them, now leave me alone"". I still remember the look of shock on her face. I don't think she expected me to reply so brazenly.

When I told Brian and Derek about this, they shared their own experience in dealing with them. This couple was rather homophobic too and had tried to talk to the property manager about ""the fags moving into a building with families and children"". They were told to fuck off (just not in so many words), but anytime either, or both of these guys were in the elevator with them, or ran into them in the parking lot, the husband (Let's call him Todd) would stand between them and his kids while giving Brian and/or Derek angry looks. Must've been trying to prevent their kids form catching ""the gay"". LOL

In the weeks that followed, the entitled couple continued to give me the stink eye any time they saw me. I just smiled back at them sweetly, which pissed them off even more. On one occasion, their teenage daughter said ""good morning"" to me and tried to make small talk, before her mother dragged her away by the arm, while berating her for talking to ""that woman"". Interestingly, their kids seemed very well behaved and nice and I truly felt sorry for them.

My next door neighbors (another couple with kids with whom I got along very well) later told me that EM had tried to get them to file a noise complaint against me. According to EM's logic, since I shared a wall with that family, they could probably hear all the ""ungodly"" noises coming from my apartment and they should complain in order to protect their children. The nice couple told them they would do no such thing as I had never bothered them and they had never heard any such noises coming out of my apartment.

One night, Brian Derek and I decided to have a foursome that would involve the three of us and Brian and Derek's friend Dean. The next morning, Dean asked if he could come back to my place with me. As it was a Sunday morning and Dean was hotter than hell, I agreed. As he and I were walking down the hallway to my place, Karen was just getting out of hers. She saw Dean and I smiling and talking and his arm around my waist and approached me, asking angrily if I was being "" a whore and selling my body"". I told her she was insane and asked her to kindly fuck off.

Later that day, I received a call from the property manager. She wanted to let me know that Karen and Todd had complained that I was "" a prostitute"" and that it was dangerous for their children to be in the same building as me. They told her in great detail about how I was bringing home different men. The property manager had gotten to know Brian and Derek quite well and had and inkling that I was friends with them. So she contacted them and they told her all about the EP's crazy behavior and accusations and that the man they had seen me with was a mutual friend, there was no prostitution going on. The property manager dissuaded EP from filing any sort of false complaint against me as it could cause a world of trouble for them. I thanked that kind lady and later had a good chuckle over it all with Brian and Derek.

The blatant harassment from Karen and Todd had stopped, but of course, the hateful looks continued. On one occasion, when we were in the elevator together, Karen tried made a pathetic attempt at shaming me by condescendingly asking if I was going to have any men over that night. What she didn't realize is that shame about my promiscuity is something I'm entirely incapable of feeling. I proceeded to tell her in great detail about all the sex acts I was going to engage in that evening. I mean, she's the one who asked, right?

After this fun little interaction, she and her husband avoided me completely. Good times.",1583658748.0,shygirlturnedsassy,True,False,False,0.49,0,237838

The whole controversy that surrounds Pokemon SwSh is getting really embarrassing,33,dui4q1,NintendoSwitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/dui4q1/the_whole_controversy_that_surrounds_pokemon_swsh/,321,"First thing first,  I do see where the fandom as a whole is coming from with worries and complaints regarding new Pokemon game - while it's not something that affects me personally as a newer fan, there are a lot of valid reasons to be disappointed, be it missing pokemon, desire for some specific features that aren't there, or just dissatisfaction with direction of the franchise as a whole. Still, they way situation was approached over those months frankly gives me a strong feeling of second-hand embarrassment and disappointment. There's a lot of reasons why, so I'll do my best to keep things short and to the point:

1. Brigading and tribalism. Maybe it's a given for any controversial situation in any fandom (especially on Reddit), but for anyone even remotely interested in a new release, discussions are simply impossible - trying to express any positive opinion about the game or just discuss something else aside of pokedex situation will get you downvoted fast, and threads are dominated by the same highly-upvoted complaints for many months because of that - situation got so severe that a decent chunk of r/pokemon netizens had to leave the subreddit and create their own ( r/PokemonSwordAndShield ) to have any sort of reasonable discussion. Speaking simply, you're getting punished for daring to like the game, and when that's the situation community *about* liking the games ends up being, then something's clearly messed up.
2. Related to above, the threads that get constantly hijacked by angry fans regardless the topic. Trailer or gameplay video? Angry fans complain about pokedex. New feature or info? Angry fans complain about pokedex. Some cool piece of fanart? Angry fans complain about pokedex. Someone made a random poll to discuss favorite new pokemon? You get the idea. It's not that criticism shouldn't be addressed, but it seems like some Pokemon fans (a decent amount of them in fact) just don't have any boundaries at all, and they're ready to turn every thread into personal ramblings about how they're upset about certain features - which, combined with aforementioned brigading and downvoting, really poisons any discussions that could be made about the project.
3. ""Armchair gamedevs"" and attacks against developers. While two above are embarrassing in their stupid amount of hostility, this one is embarrassing exactly due to ""amount of stupid"". Some downright claim that GameFreak is ""lazy"" while barely having knowledge/involvement in making games, some pre-emptively jump the horse and complain about features that weren't even announced, some just push their ""real and holy"" vision of what franchise should be down other people's throats while stating that they're objectively right. It's not the first time I see people being know-it-alls about specific games and series, but its the first time I see so many of them in one place - with that sheer amount of true and honest talent, you may as well start your own company.
4. ***Actual*** attacks against developers - from metabombing their other projects (like it was with Little Town Hero), to all sorts of personal threats. I don't feel like I even need to comment on it.
5. All in all, just general sense of entitlement that leaks into all above? Some fans (again, a disappointingly large amount of fans) *demand* a Pokemon game that they should like. GameFreak doesn't satisfy their tastes, and for them, it justifies attacking other fans, ruining any discussions about the game, berating developers for ""laziness"", ruining scores for their other games, and actively harrassing them on social networks. Instead of expressing criticisms in constructive way, waiting out for another entry or just simply moving away from the franchise, people go to great lengths to harm other people over a game they kinda didn't like, and that's just the kind of behavior that alienates you from any interactions and joy you could potentially have with the fandom.

Maybe it's just all me, and I'm being hyperbolic about all above? I don't even know at this point - I'm not usually the type to make rambly rant posts, but all things above seems to continue for months without any end in sight, so I think it should be addressed at least somehow.",1573422965.0,Pipistrele,True,False,False,0.52,33,1991118

If you aren't finding the game enjoyable, take a break, no one is forcing you to play it.

I stopped playing at around season of dawn and came back last week and I'm actually really enjoying myself.

Bounties are a non issue as i just dont do the one i don't enjoy EG: grenade kills in crucible 

And im actually having a lot of fun with guardian games, the bounties allow me to play and see builds that would otherwise not be in use. 

And i love the sense of competition it adds, im a Warlock main and seeing the warlocks and hunters so close to each other gets me in the competitive spirit.

And to add on to that, i dont think they are rigged, maybe bungie realized that they didnt tone down hunters enough due to the staggering population, so they toned them down a little more, but who knows, we'll have to wait and see.

I love the cool ghost shells that were added as rewards for PLAYING the game, i could definetly see them being ev only but they arent.

The new exotic seems cool and im sure i will get it in the coming weeks this event is active.

You dont have to do everything day one or week one, you have time, enjoy yourself.

EDIT: I seem to have been misinterpreted a bit, im not saying to quit the game the game, I'm saying to take a day or week long break, take a step back, play another game that day or play destiny purely casually

Y'all go off, i wanna see if we can get 100 comments before 100 upvotes

Thanks for the 100 comments strangers

Holy shit, i went to take a nap and come back to 78 notifications, rip inbox

Y'all look, if this is a repost as some might say, i never saw a post like this, because it all gets drowned out by all the complaint posts, i thought I was making a positive post in these ""trying"" times, sure the game might not be in the best place right now, but if we compare it to d1s droughts and lackluster year 1 expansions, we are fucking spoiled right now, look if yall really dislike the way games going right now, then why are you playing it, seriously, why put yourself what you say is a miserable experience if you arent having fun, because you spent 10 dollars on a dlc that ""wasnt worth the money?"" Fuck off, if you look at the content you got its well worth the money.

Maybe I just have the best RNG ever, but recently I got a Gun Goddess MF skin permanent out of a chest, and then later got a Spirit Guard Udyr skin permanent from another chest. Just yesterday I got a shard for the cool new Ezreal skin and was able to sell a bunch of my other shards to upgrade it. Of course alot of the skin shards you get are not that cool or for obscure champs, but you can just save them up for when you eventually get a shard you like.

Message from Greece.,6,cso6zd,Sino,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sino/comments/cso6zd/message_from_greece/,69,"Greek citizen here.

I want to express my unyielding support and admiration for China and its leadership and to share a couple of thoughts at these perilous times.

First lets start with this: the idea that the whole world stands with honk kong is far from reality and indeed very one sided.

People who know full well what american hegemonism is capable of doing is actually quite substantial. One only has to look at the statistic collected by frequent polls conducted by governments on their local population on how much they like Americans.

In greece anti-American sentiment is shared by about 70% of the population. The government is trying really hard to revert this but Americans always manage to come up with something that skyrockets that hard gained decrease in anti-american sentiment.

A little bit on the north in the balkans the anti-American sentiment is even higher. Let me not mention the Middle east, Russia, Latin america and parts of Africa.

Now trust me when i say that everyone; and i mean everyone who has any brains and is interested in politics is watching this protests knowing full well how certain people and governments that are spreading democracy and human rights are secretly or not so secretly smirking and filling their hearts with dark happiness as they watch China and its people facing difficulties.

Now and thats the most important point in my opinion.

Democracy sounds all very nice and rosy. It is a very powerful idea indeed. Let's see the turnover in the national elections for greece shall we.

Since 2000 the turnover has been arround 40-55%. That means that 1 in 2 does not go to vote.

People are completely disgusted by our politicians and their so called representative democracy.  Over and over, again and again they have misguided us, fooled us, out right lied to us. We even had a referendum and they reversed the results... (democracy....)

That sentiment is shared in most of the so called progressive democratic countries. Go converse with any hard working person. Speak about politics you are probably going to get scorned.

What iam trying to say is that democracy is just a political system. And a political system is comprised of people. I would rather have your leadership 100 times over mine and still have one party rule without any fucking vote.

Dont let them discourage you. Fuck them and their democracy. What matters is not the political system but the people that make it. And so far your leadership has done tremendous things for your people. I sincerely hope that your leadership continues to strive for the betterment of all China; you still have a lot to do; Dont let anybody stop you; Dont let anybody belittle you; Stand proud god dammit.

You have a history of 5000 years. Your people have gone through some of the hardest times and yet here you are. 5 thousand years still struggling; still fighting.

You have been victims of manipulation; theft; genocide; invasion, racism; envy. (Dont let yourselfs feel like the victim; losers do that and that aint you.)

Rise above it my  brothers.

"The Amish Don’t Get Vaccinated and They Rarely Get Autism, Cancer, or Heart Disease — Coincidence?",5,bt7y6s,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/bt7y6s/the_amish_dont_get_vaccinated_and_they_rarely_get/,114,"&#x200B;

Do not talk about whether vaccines work or not, or whether or not they cause autism, unless you’re ready for a very  heated debate. Although the link between vaccines and autism is nothing new, to even speak of it can get you labeled as an “anti-vaxxer” or a  health fanatic of sorts by the sheeple (brainwashed masses) that believe every vaccine the CDC recommends not only works, but is 100% safe and 100% effective 100% of the time. Even if some vaccines work some of the  time, are they worth the health risk? That is the ultimate question, because one statistic you may not know is that children who receive [mercury-containing vaccinations](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/http://www.healing-arts.org/children/mercury_in_vaccines_autism_research/thimerosalinvaccinationslink.htm) (listed as thimerosal usually) are [27 times more likely](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/http://traceamounts.com/ten-lies-told-about-mercury-in-vaccines/) to develop [autism](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/http://www.truthwiki.org/autism-asperger-syndrome-asd/) than those who don’t get those jabs. That comes from a recent study  based on the CDC’s own data. Still want to keep it a hush-hush topic?

Pediatricians in America are not allowed to question vaccines at all, nor are they allowed to recommend less than the CDC recommends, or they face the wrath of the AMA – the infamous American Medical Association –  that finds a way to shut down the “contenders,” sometimes even taking away their license to practice medicine. Big question: would the statistics of autism suddenly bottom out if mercury was removed from all vaccines, including flu shots? (By the way, the CDC lied when they said  mercury has been removed from all vaccines).

**Nary is a case of autism in the Amish communities of America**

For starters, children are not born with autism. It appears during infancy or childhood, and is brought on by an overload of neurotoxins either consumed, injected or ingested from environmental factors, or all of the above. In fact, the recent autism spectrum disorder (ASD) spike over the past two decades in the USA directly coincides with the vaccine schedule increase, by quantity and frequency, enforced by the CDC. To understand why autism is next to non-existent for the Amish, consider  that the Amish have been “cut off” from American scientific and medical “progress” for centuries, thus they’ve had less exposure to the major factors that trigger autism, including the most likely  proponent–vaccines.

Take a little trip to the heart of [Pennsylvania Dutch country](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/http://yournewswire.com/why-dont-amish-children-get-autism/) and try to tag yourself even half a dozen Amish children with autism and you’ll come up short. **If statistics matched our national average, there would be about 200 in the Amish community, but to date, there are only three, one of which was adopted and brought over from China.** Go figure. Another one actually did get vaccinated and developed autism shortly afterwards. Go figure again.

Here are some universal and national statistics to consider. Autism affects over 20 million people around the world, and occurs in boys four to five times more often than girls. In the US, one in every 68 children has some form of ASD, a 30% increase from just 2012. Why is that, you’re asking yourself? United States kids get 50 inoculations before age seven, many that are combinations containing multiple disease strains, mercury, formaldehyde (yes, embalming fluid for the dead), monosodium glutamate (MSG) and aluminum, just to name a few neurotoxins. Flu shots contain the highest levels of mercury, up to 25,000 times  what the EPA allows as a maximum in drinking water and edible fish.  Mercury is the second most poisonous element know to mankind.

**Due to religious beliefs, the Amish opt out of all vaccines**

Fortunately for the Amish, they’re also opting out of three of the most controversial vaccines on the market today: hepatitis B, HPV (human  papillomavirus) and of course, the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella combo)  that was implicated in the [CDC vaccine-autism-link](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/http://www.truthwiki.org/dr-william-thompson/) and biggest medical cover-up in history, ever. Conflicting with CDC claims, the multi-dose version of hepatitis B still contains thimerosal  (50% mercury). The immature central nervous systems and the liver of Amish newborns are spared this volatile toxin thanks to their parent’s religious beliefs. [Amish children ](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/http://12160.info/m/discussion?id=2649739%3ATopic%3A1536735)experience hardly any learning disabilities at all, in fact. Nor are the Amish experiencing typical US diseases like cancer, heart disease and  diabetes. This could all be because they [don’t eat GMO](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/https://truthkings.com/amish-people-hardly-ever-get-cancer/), take chemical pharmaceuticals, or vaccines. Surely, no government run  regulatory agency will ever run this comparison of Amish health vs. non-Amish health, but the reality speaks for itself.

Still, the [CDC refuses to regulate](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/http://www.cdc.news/) the vaccine industry and instead literally promotes toxic chemicals, dangerous heavy metal toxins, carcinogens and lethal “preservatives” like mercury. It’s all about [lifestyle and natural health](https://web.archive.org/web/20170206002037/https://www.healthrangerstore.com/pages/search-results?q=natural%20health&disable_semantics=1) these days, if you really want immunity that doesn’t come with a boatload of permanent and debilitating “side effects,” like autism spectrum disorder, Asperger’s syndrome or liver cancer.

Like I get not being full progressive on all things, but labeling yourself as a conservative is just selfish and naive to me. Society and the world are always changing....and you want things to stay the same, knowing full well that means hurting people that are not yet as comfortable and accepted as you are?

Republicans love to think they are the party of Lincoln and Teddy. But they are not. They are the party if conservativism, meaning the party of people that opposed the 13th amendment (yes that was Democrats back then but they parties have switched and if anyone does not understand that are just not worth talking to), that were pro segregation, anti gay rights, that are anti trans rights, etc

Even if they weren't about doing mental gymnastics to defend this POTUS, I still don't think I could ever understand their position

Even less so given that poor Republicans always vote against their own self interested just to stick it to the immigrants or whatever scapegoat their rich representatives have chosen

Conservatives are against welfare because it's ""communism"", because ""I got mine""

This is all fine if you are ok with admitting you are an extreme believer of self sufficience and you are ok with admitting you don't want things to change because everything is already great *for you*

Being conservative is being selfish, not having empathy, and being ok with discrimination because you yourself are not a victim of it

Taking Damage Shouldn’t Reset Revive Progress in Trials,9,fk68ni,DestinyTheGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fk68ni/taking_damage_shouldnt_reset_revive_progress_in/,59,"Now that the first weekend of Trials is wrapping up, I’d like to draw attention to an issue that a lot of people I’ve spoken with agree is problematic, yet largely hasn’t surfaced in the discussion - the Trials/Elimination revive mechanic. I’ll lay out my case in a lot more detail below, but here’s the top line:

**TL;DR:** Bungie should roll back the revive mechanic to PVE/D1 behavior, where you can revive a teammate while taking damage. The way it functions now is vestigial from D2Y1 Countdown, and its inclusion in Elimination and ToO stifles an otherwise promising game mode.

###Background - Why This Mechanic Exists

Currently, taking any amount of damage while attempting to revive a teammate in Elimination or Trials of Osiris will reset the revive bar. This damage can come from *any* source: a grenade, Thorn tick damage, a Titan shield, etc. Revives don’t behave this way in PVE, nor did they have that mechanic at any point in Destiny 1.

So why does this mechanic exist in Trials of Osiris? Trials of the Nine. Yes, that one. Destiny 2 launched without readily-available one-hit weapons or abilities, with special weapons locked behind heavy ammo and grenades doing paltry damage. In that environment, easily reviving a player in Countdown, especially in Trials, would have been problematic. There would be no way to shut down a newly-revived player, which would minimize the penalty of getting picked/the reward of getting an early kill in a round. By letting small amounts of damage reset the bar, players had a way to control revive orbs with their Uriel’s Gifts *shudder*.

###What’s Changed

Okay, you’ve made a pretty good argument for this mechanic existing, I hear you say. What’s changed? **We all have special weapons now**. Unless you’ve just rolled out from under a rock, if you’re competitive in Destiny 2 you’re now running either a 1HKO special weapon or a very fast TTK sidearm or SMG. Everybody has immediate access to a fast, secure way to shut down revived players. In fact, it’s now easier than ever to kill a newly-revived player, as there are no longer immune-frames on spawn.

###Why Bungie Should Remove This Mechanic

You may have noticed that new ToO games are much faster than you remember, with lower kill-counts across the board. Part of the difference is a higher base movement speed, but more-so, nobody is getting revives any more. 

In my opinion, fast, unfettered access to player revives is fundamental to the character of Elimination and Trials, without which we’re left with Survival++. To get into specifics, here are three reasons why the mechanic should change:

1.	Knowing how and when to revive your teammates adds a more nuanced skill gap to the game. Everybody knows the difference between a good res and a bad res. A good player knows how to push for their teammates orb, revive them under fire, and play their res shield (or bait their teammate) into more kills. A bad player repeatedly reses their teammate into sniper fire. The current system essentially removes all of this depth from the game.
2.	Not being able to easily secure revives stifles the options of players in a 2v3 or 1v3. Think back to your favorite D1 streamers, and I’m sure you can remember them pulling off an awesome clutch or comeback. As a D1 Trials Sherpa myself, 90% of my clutches involved strategic use of player orbs, whether that be a tactical revive of a teammate or baiting an enemy revive. As things stand, reviving your teammate is next to impossible unless your team has locked down the area, and a large contingent of people I’ve played with and against this weekend just ignore revives.
3.	The way things work now disproportionately advantages Titans over other classes, since they have the ability to wall off orbs. While I agree this should yield them some advantage, that advantage should be the ability to revive their teammates into some degree of safety, not simply to revive their teammate *at all*. Right now, a team is at a strong deficit if they don’t have a Titan with high resilience.

###Potential Counterpoints

I can anticipate a few of the opposing arguments I’m going to get. Here’s my response:

-	*It’s called ‘Elimination’. Dying should be penalized.* I agree there should be consequences for dying, but we have revive orbs for a reason. Survival with no extra lives is an interesting game type in its own right, but the kinetic chess game that emerges when two good teams battle over respawn orbs is, in my opinion, essential to what makes Trials unique and fun.
-	*People playing for revives will just slow the game down.* On the contrary, I think making it possible for players to push into enemy fire to get their friends up will make the game more dynamic.
-	*Players being able to sprint through respawns in Destiny 1 was stupid and shouldn’t come back.* 100% agree. Bungie nerfed that ability midway through D1 and I’m not advocating for it to come back. If you want to respawn your friend, you should still have to expose yourself to enemy fire. 

###Who Am I?

If it lends my point any credibility, I’ve been at this a while and there’s a reason I’m so passionate about Trials. I was a [Trials Sherpa in Destiny 1](https://reddit.com/r/CrucibleSherpa/comments/6ae71j/sherpa_cardxb1_lanamtrahunt_new_meta_confrimed/), and I’ve [already helped](https://trials.report/report/1/4611686018429581586) 11 clanmates, friends, and some random players get their first flawless in Destiny 2. From my experience, I really believe that the revive system we have right now is a limiting factor on what is otherwise (barring lackluster flawless rewards) shaping up to be the playlist we’ve all been hoping and waiting for. I love Trials and want it to succeed.",1584455572.0,UncheckedException,True,False,False,0.51,9,1491786

Jaclyn Hill lipsticks natural ingredients - an explanation,4,c6ki1k,BeautyGuruChatter,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/c6ki1k/jaclyn_hill_lipsticks_natural_ingredients_an/,53,"Dear Community,

as in the lipstickgate so many speculations came up, what is wrong with the ingredients and if they cause the problems, i thought, a general ""education"" post for ingredients could be helpfull. Not only for JHs lipsticks, but to become a better informed consumer in generall. Too, it makes me really sad, that natural ingredients came under fire in the subtexts of some posts, although they are in general way better for the skin (and good skincondition on the lips is actually important for lipsticks to just look good...).

 

**Natural and mineral oils**

We need to distinguish between natural and mineral oil products. Mineral products (such as paraffinum and petrolatum) never go rancid. But they too are under suspicion of causing cancer and they give no benefit in skincare, as your skin can not use them.

Natural oils can oxidate (going rancid) in very different timeframes. Jojobaoil for example has a shelflife of two years. Cranberryseedoil only have 3 month! If you mix oxidation-resistant oils like jojoba with unstabile oils like cranberryseedoil, the jojoba ""stabilises"" the vulnerable component (a little bit...) and they together last longer, than these three month. Oxidation is a chain reaction wich is not stopable, once it started and it's impossible to not start it in the process of producing natural oils. Antioxidants like vitamin e (tocopherol) slows it down, cooling, lack of sunlight and oxygen slows it down, but it is never fully stopped, as it is once started too an enzymatic process.

(Little extra: this is why the most precious oils of skincare, like cranberryseedoil, is mostly incorporated in nightcare and not in daycare or in lipproducts and foundations etc. The sunlight would oxidate your precious care right on your skin. Oxidated oils act like radicals with your skin and therefor would cause premature aging. Don't use nightcare, when your skin is exposed to the sun.)

**Conclusion:** Natural oils are an excellent skincare, as long as they are handled with care. The raw materials need to be cooled etc., everything to protect them from oxidation. But what ever is done to protect them: their shelflife is limited to two, maybe three years. So many of you said ""I got 15 years old lipsticks, that smell better than JHs"" and this is true. But not a sign of quality... A lipstick made without aorganic oils, but only with above mentioned mineral oil products, can easily survive that long. (But would you eat a burger, that doesn't show mold after 15 years and claim that a sign of quality?). However: maybe these lipsticks are old, maybe they were fresh made, but the raw material was at the end of it's shelflife already, maybe raw materials was bought from a very cheap production, sitting uncooled and open in the sun to cause faster oxidation... if it smells rancid, it is most likely rancid.

***Dont use anything, that smells rancid.***

&#x200B;

**Water vs. Oil**

To be honest: I don't see any good reason, why there should be water in a lipstick in the first place. Those formulations do exist, no doubt, but you need to search hard for a lipstic with aqua in the ingredients... But let's go for the real informations.

Mold, fungus and bacteria are present everywhere at any time, but all needs water to grow. A product, that does not contain water, doesn't need preservations against these (it does need antioxidants for the oils, butter, waxes and I am not sure if these are included in the english word ""preservation"", but want to be precise on that). 

How preservation (roughly) works: The origin of the bacteria / fungus / mold (shortend to ""bacteria"" in the following paragraph) are the raw materials, tools for processing, humans just breathing near the materials etc.  We all know from school these graphs for bacteria growth: x². Added in the process of production, preservations will kill \*most\* of the bacteria , but never all (you know: this desinfection will kill 99,9%  of blabla). So a pruduct is not free of any bacteria, it is only put down on a level, where it takes a lot of time, to grow back the population to a harmfull level. Most producers have a so called ""preservation reserve"", that will also kill some of the bacterias brought into the product in the use. For example pots, where consumers go in with their fingers.

But here is the problem, with the JH lipsticks: the amount of preservation you need to thin down the population to that level (+ the reserve) is calculated by the *usual* amount of bacterias raw material has, is added in production, will be put in by customers dirty fingers. If there are unknown shards and hair in the product (come on... hair? for sure hasn't been desinfected!) the amount of bacteria already in the process of production is above the level you need to go under to constrain the growth. Even worse: they are maybe heated up, but not boiled, for example in the melting process of the butters along with the water, which would even promote the growth! Depending on the preservation-system it can fail for many reasons (to warm, to cold, PH-level to high / to low, even if the PH changes in just one step of the production and goes back to right one after and many more reasons).

But **definitly** preservation fails, when the amount of bacteria is too high! That's why all the professionals freak out about the hair. Of cause you don't get a desease or skin irritation by touching the hair of a stranger... but cultivate the bacteria of even your own hair, grow them into a population denser than singapores and it **will cause a reaction**! The most harmless reaction is just to mess up the balance of your skins natural microbiom, but it could also be a population of pathogenics, causing serious deseases.

**Conclusion:** Even if the product is fresh made as JH claims and a suiting preservation-system is present, when products contains unintended ingredients, of which you can not say, if they were desinfected, it is not save anymore. It is contaminated.

***Dont use anything, that has unintended objects in it.***

&#x200B;

And to address the speculation, that we all would like to know: Only judging by this information, we can not say, if they are old or poorly produced fresh.

Preservation last for a specific amount of time usually, but as the product is contaminated, it could also fail although it is fresh. Oils, butters and waxes do go rancid, when they are old, but they to could go rancid early by careless handling and the fact, that the ingredients are not perfectly blended (remember the explanation of stabilising...). But in my personal opinion, the fact that they are rancid is a strong hint, that they are old. There is no very oxidation-vulnerable component in the formulation, that would go from perfectly fine to smelly in one month...",1561730207.0,Guest48326,True,False,False,0.51,4,169393

**Projection**

When the Top Minds and hate subs claim that other subs are the ones brigading them it's always projection.   After seeing a meme spreading the disgusting hoax created by hate sub users to smear AHS, several PCM users call for another one of their  famous brigades to continue their prolonged harassment campaign against AHS.    


Hundreds memes and comments have been made on PCM accusing the users of AHS of being pedophiles who commit serious criminal offenses.   They are all promoting the vile harassment campaign and pushing the hoax concocted by hate sub users.   Even though it is against Reddit's TOS to post impersonating content these groups continue to push faked evidence impersonating ""AHS users"" with impunity.   


It seems that hate groups are going to keep escalating their behavior and their mods are going to keep promoting this disgusting content.   [[HERE]](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/g2e6o3/yet_another_user_from_rpoliticalcompassmemes/)  you can see it was only a few days ago when the latest PCM user threatened to raid AHS with child exploitation material.   And unsurprisingly not even making such calls and such threats will get you banned from PCM, because it seems like their mods endorse harassment not matter how vile.

You want characters using a large variety of legendary guns, not two or three that dramatically outclass everything else available! And it's absurd to expect them to buff *literally every other piece of gear in the game* to bring them up to par with a few overpowered pieces.

The world hates men and it’s a scary time to not be able to own a woman and oooooh, some girl glanced at him in the store today and it made him so mad that she didn’t immediately suck his dick right then that he threw his bread at her, yadda yadda. Yet the “extreme” women, this sub, are literally bringing the facts like hey, has anyone considered that it’s not cool literally 95% of all violent sex crimes are committed by men, yet like .05% of them ever see any slight justice and most people are just screaming about the tiny amount of women who have done something not good? 

Literally ALL OF THE ENTIRETY OF HUMAN HISTORY men have abused, hurt, and forced down women. And in the few years where women yanked a few basic human rights out of their grasp, it made men sob and whine and rage over it. An entire half of the population has been nothing more than “pets” since the dawn of humanity. Walking holes. Objects to serve food and show boobs. No rights, no protections, no tenderness in a frozen man’s world. Now that some societies in the world has changed, there’s still ridiculous pushback. No one wants to hear truths.

Men are a million times more vocal, especially about things they should shut the fuck up about. There’s about a thousand subs supporting extreme men and their made up issues they invent to whine about any lose of control, and then only this one for women who speak real experiences, historical data, statistics and real life issues that everyone will hate them for mentioning.

Getting killed by police is a leading cause of death for young black men in America,0,dgifbj,Sino,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sino/comments/dgifbj/getting_killed_by_police_is_a_leading_cause_of/,35,"Just another example of the hidden, systematic racism and discrimination targeted against African-American minorities in the United States.

https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2019-08-15/police-shootings-are-a-leading-cause-of-death-for-black-men

About 1 in 1,000 black men and boys in America can expect to die at the hands of police, according to a new analysis of deaths involving law enforcement officers. That makes them 2.5 times more likely than white men and boys to die during an encounter with cops.

The analysis also showed that Latino men and boys, black women and girls and Native American men, women and children are also killed by police at higher rates than their white peers. But the vulnerability of black males was particularly striking.

“That 1-in-1,000 number struck us as quite high,” said study leader Frank Edwards, a sociologist at Rutgers University. **“That’s better odds of being killed by police than you have of winning a lot of scratch-off lottery games.”**

For instance, black women were about 1.4 times as likely to be killed by police as white women, the researchers found. Native American women were from 1.1 to 2.1 times as likely to be killed as their white peers.

The early 20s are a particularly dangerous time for young men, the researchers found. During the study period, police use of force accounted for 1.6% of all deaths of black men between the ages of 20 and 24. It was also responsible for 1.2% of deaths of Latino and Native American men. However, police violence accounted for just 0.5% of deaths of white and Asian American men in that age range.

Justin Feldman, a social epidemiologist at the New York University School of Medicine, said the most striking result for him was the mortality risk for black men and boys, which he called “pretty staggering.”

“That’s quite meaningful,” said Feldman, who was not involved in the study. “If it’s not you being killed by police, it’s someone you know or someone in your community.”

**“The United States is unique among wealthy democracies in terms of the number of people that are killed by its police forces,”** Feldman said. “I think the No. 1 thing it comes down to is a lack of accountability by police departments, both legally and politically.”",1570815073.0,BitterMelonX,True,False,False,0.49,0,40998

This is a direct clip from the Teamspeak server of TDSIN tonight, where CEO and CSM member ExookiZ, among other things, tells his members to deliver items to all members of Fraternity. in order to crash the server when their staging dies. For those who are unaware, every individual characters items inside a wh citadel produces a single cargo container in space upon structure death. Thus, it is theoretically possible to produce enough cans via this method to lag out or entirely crash a server. 

TDSIN members are attempting to say this is just a joke, but considering they have even made a discord channel to coordinate the creation of extra cargo cans upon their staging structures death tonight, that's some real spin. 

Will be interesting to see what happens tonight in Solaris.

it's like a tough love. i love me\_irl but i so badly want it to return to its glory days. when i judge a me\_irl i take into account it's relatability:

""this is me\_irl"" means i believe it is like what i just said, a post that is weirdly relatable and that is in the spirit of me_irl. many can look at this post and say ""this is me_irl"".

""this might be me\_irl"" means either i do not relate to it, but i think a decent chunk of people can, or that i can relate to it but i'm not sure enough people can.

""this is not me\_irl"" is obvious. this meme might be funny or original but it is no selfie of the soul. it could probably do well on another sub but me\_irl is not where it belongs.

anything else is situational.

Apple's Privacy myth needs to end,170,esl78u,privacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/esl78u/apples_privacy_myth_needs_to_end/,251,"It’s pretty clear that many members of this community have very little understanding of privacy, falling victim to mainstream media’s depiction of it and the world in general—the very power system(s) they're trying to combat. The belief in Apple as privacy-oriented is one such illusion. So before starting I highly suggest people educate themselves on media and propaganda (I’ll happily provide book recommendations) to develop a more critical framework. A good introduction is [this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwmWnphqII).

A rough summary is that mainstream media are huge corporations whose profit-making comes not from readers/viewers or paid subscribers, but advertisers. This means there’s two important institutional constraints on media ideology: that of their owners and of their buyers. Both inherently determine their values and the kind of content they make. Corporate media are businesses selling products (us, consumers) to other businesses. What kind of ideology and picture of the world do you think you’re getting from that?

The rest of this post is written under the assumption that this sub is informed enough to view Apple as nothing more than “the lesser of evils”. A perspective I will argue is still misguided.

**1.** **USER IDENTIFICATION:**

Outside the ones shared by all competing products in the industry, there are additional ways to identify you in specifically Apple products.

1. iOS subliminally and constantly collects sensitive data and links it to hardware identifiers almost guaranteed to link to a real identity.
2. iOS forces users to activate devices which sets up a remote UUID-linked (also collecting registration IP) database for a given device with Apple’s services.
3. iOS and iOS-based coprocessors force the regular sending of incredibly sensitive metadata to Apple for the mere ability to use the device for questionable and unknown reasons.

**2.1. PRIVACY POLICY IN PRACTICE IN REGARDS TO THE AUTHORITIES:**

Apple is subject to the [FISA Amendments Act of 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act_of_1978_Amendments_Act_of_2008), and PRISM is an example of that law in practice, which they are a part of.

As public disclosure of cooperation with authorities have been allowed in in limited degrees in recent years, we’ve seen examples like Apple admitting to [complying with 90% of government requests of accessing thousands of user file](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-complies-percent-us-government-requests-customer-data-2020-1?r=US&IR=T)[s every year](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-complies-percent-us-government-requests-customer-data-2020-1?r=US&IR=T); **FBI openly praised them for providing ""ample assistance""**. It therefore came as no surprise when a recent leak revealed that [the company purposefully kept their phones less secure to make ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive/exclusive-apple-dropped-plan-for-encrypting-backups-after-fbi-complained-sources-idUSKBN1ZK1CT?utm_source=reddit.com)[access easier for the authorities](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive/exclusive-apple-dropped-plan-for-encrypting-backups-after-fbi-complained-sources-idUSKBN1ZK1CT). Despite all this, Apple is still most associated with the FBI encryption dispute in 2015, which has been a huge PR success for them.

The latter case, [which w](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/internet-privacy/one-fbis-major-claims-iphone-case-fraudulent?redirect=blog/free-future/one-fbis-major-claims-iphone-case-fraudulent)[as completely fraudulent](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/internet-privacy/one-fbis-major-claims-iphone-case-fraudulent?redirect=blog/free-future/one-fbis-major-claims-iphone-case-fraudulent), is still widely circulated and frequently brought up as a demonstration of the company's integrity. In reality it was a demonstration, like the general theme of much else in this post, of successful media propaganda. Apple (or even FBI) aren’t able to fool professional and well-educated journalists of NYT, WP, etc--they rely on the media's conformity through misrepresentation of the available facts, as well as accessible and well-known critique. It all happens quite ""freely"", due to the institutional constraints mentioned in the second paragraph of this post.

Apple have outlined how [they give virtually everything relevant ](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/05/new-guidelines-outline-what-iphone-data-apple-can-give-to-police/)[on iCloud to the authorities](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/05/new-guidelines-outline-what-iphone-data-apple-can-give-to-police/). As the CEO of ElcomSot, a security company that revealed iCloud was uploading data to Apple servers without users knowing, said: [""The takeaway really is don't ever used iCloud"".](https://theintercept.com/2016/11/17/iphones-secretly-send-call-history-to-apple-security-firm-says/) Apple having the encryption keys to iCloud as well as other parts of your iPhone completely invalidates the point of E2EE, and might explain why/how [**NSA mines**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html)[ ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html)[**data directly from their servers**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html)**.**

The company's respect for privacy is no better outside the US. We know that they [oblige and assist authoritarian governments](https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2017/11/24/apple-we-can-promote-freedom-of-expression-in-china-as-we-block-vpn-apps) like China in installing firewalls to block citizens' access to encrypted tools like social media apps. They’re actively undermining people’s security and privacy from violent regimes for the sake of profit.

**2.2. PRIVACY POLICY IN PRACTICE IN REGARDS TO THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY.**

[Apple sells](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/01/apples-hypocritical-defense-data-privacy/581680/)[ ](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/01/apples-hypocritical-defense-data-privacy/581680/)[certificates to third-party developers that allow the](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/01/apples-hypocritical-defense-data-privacy/581680/)[m ](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/01/apples-hypocritical-defense-data-privacy/581680/)[to track users](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/01/apples-hypocritical-defense-data-privacy/581680/)—**third-party developers are allowed to collect data on iOS.** Facebook's privacy scandal (interestingly, [Apple themselves were one of the main partners buying data from Facebook](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/03/technology/facebook-device-partners-users-friends-data.html)) involved iOS users as well due to the mentioned tracking. Tim Cook reacted to the scandal with another publicity stunt by superficially punishing Facebook. A real response, like removing Facebook from the App Store or removing their ability to track you, did not happen.

The company attacks Google and Facebook's intrusion on users' privacy, yet are enabling them and other businesses in doing so on their products. They even use Google as Safari's default search provider—[making ](https://fortune.com/2018/09/29/google-apple-safari-search-engine/)[12 billion USD in 2019 alone from this deal.](https://fortune.com/2018/09/29/google-apple-safari-search-engine/)

If they really cared about privacy they would deny the ability of privacy-invasive apps to collect any user date. They don't because these apps' importance in keeping their products' platform popular and therefore profitable.

**3. THE LACK OF OPEN SOURCE CODE.**

Open source code, specifically those that have been audited, is for obvious reasons much safer than closed source ones. [Even government ](https://keepass.info/ratings.html)[agencies take it into account in choosing secure software for their members.](https://keepass.info/ratings.html)

It is all the more important when the company in question surrenders data to state authorities, allows third-party developers to collect data, [have weak security measures ](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-differential-privacy-shortcomings/)(sometimes on purpose) and havr had numerous suspicious activities discovered. Not to mention the fact that Apple's verification mechanism is designed in such a way that they have the ability to [“silently send targeted malicious updates to devices matching specific unique ID criteria”](https://gist.github.com/iosecure/357e724811fe04167332ef54e736670d). **iOS is a textbook example of why closed source is bad.**

Imagine if Huawei, on top of providing third-party developers the ability to track its users, admitted to giving the Chinese government access to user data (but only after it was caught doing so) and were continuously caught in suspicious activities (many involving Chinese authorities)—all on a completely closed source software platform. Would you take their claims of ""security"" and ""privacy"" seriously?

Many users (predominately Americans) already have a hard time trusting Huawei, [despite 0 evidence of illegal data collection ](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/e5znge/huawei_aims_for_desktop_pc_market_with/f9om1yd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)[of users](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/e5znge/huawei_aims_for_desktop_pc_market_with/f9om1yd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)[ or ](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/e5znge/huawei_aims_for_desktop_pc_market_with/f9om1yd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)[claimed connections with the CCP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/e5znge/huawei_aims_for_desktop_pc_market_with/f9om1yd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) Users have bought into US government claims and mainstream media propaganda. At the same time they buy and congratulate Apple for their privacy-oriented approach. **A perfect example of a system of indoctrination.**

**4. ALTERNATIVES.**

Here are some *reasonable* steps with descending order in how effective they are, that provide you with Android-based alternatives superior to iOS in privacy and security:

**1:** Disable Google tracking and services in settings (the little that they make available to you) and use F-Droid instead of Play Store. Notwithstanding the lack of privacy in many ways, it's a good starting point.

\-At this point your privacy from private companies is a bit better than on iOS.

**1.5:** Some OEMs, like Huawei, simplify and help users uninstall Google apps and services. Huawei’s current products (like Mate Pro 30) also come without all that, due to the current trade war. The phones still come with Huawei bloat and their ad-based data mining, but it’s nowhere as bad as Google and easier to evade.

\-At this point your privacy from private companies is better than on iOS.

**2:** Root your device (an easy task) and uninstall all Google apps and services, as well as anything else, completely.

\-At this point your privacy from both government and private companies is better than on iOS.

**3:** Install Custom ROMs that allow the same as **2**, have even more open software for examination and also include enhanced privacy features in the system (or you can get these as third-party apps). Some, like LineageOS, also provide UI, performance and update cycles superior to almost all the main Android OSes (One UI, MIUI, EMUI, LG UI, etc.)

\-At this point your privacy from both government and private companies is significantly better than on iOS.

**4:** GrapheneOS. It provides an exceptional level of privacy and security that has been [praised by ](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1175430722733129729?s=09)[Snowden](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1175430722733129729?s=09) himself. It runs a stock Android setup with the same pros as LOS above, making it very well from a non-privacy perspective as well. If you want a user-friendly and highly privacy-related platform without having to do a lot of tinkering and manual management, this is the ROM for you.

\-At this point your privacy from both government and private companies is tremendously better than on iOS.

**5. SUMMARY: IPHONES ARE NOT THE BEST ALTERNATIVE FOR DATA PRIVACY.**

iPhones give no additional security and privacy from the government over Android phones. They only do in limited conditions that are inconsequential to this sub. It's not better out of the box, nor is it the minute you want to improve your privacy and security beyond what you get out of the box (where iOS is terrible). **It is not the ""lesser of evils""— a myth that needs to die.**

Additionally, positioning themselves as a beacon of privacy make them even more dangerous, as they become a honeypot for people in severe need of privacy. This has profound consequences in authoritarian societies for journalists, demonstrators and other dissidents. [COINTELPRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO) has shown how ugly it can get in free societies as well.

If Apple's software and ecosystem is more important to you than increased security on even some of the best UX alternatives on Android (LOS, GrapheneOS, etc), then at least admit to this hard truth and move on. Spreading misinformation undermines the privacy of others, and doing that to serve your confirmation bias is disingenuous and honestly deplorable.",1579740091.0,ColtMrFire,True,False,False,0.57,170,807199

Can we talk about sex vs. gender?,0,d2gy5c,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/d2gy5c/can_we_talk_about_sex_vs_gender/,86,"The conflation of sex and gender has really been frustrating me since becoming pregnant. I'm hoping that anyone who chooses to respond to this can understand that I don't mean what I'm writing as an attack on anyone's personal choices. I'm curious instead if anyone else shares my same concerns or frustrations, and if there's anything other than correcting everyone who asks me, ""Are you gonna find out the gender?"" that I can be doing address this frustration.

Sex is determined on a biological basis. When we see a lil' ween on the anatomy scan, our doctor is determining that the sex of our child is male. Or when our NIPT results come back having found only X chromosomes, that means our child's sex is female. 

Gender is identity based, and there's just no way for any of us to know definitively the individual gender of our unborn children. Further, gender is constructed over time and as such is fluid - a child who identifies as female at age 5 may not feel the same at 50, or 15. Yes, gender is shaped by social constructs and norms, and sex generally drives the gender we initially raise children as (i.e. if I have a child with a vagina, I will personally raise them as a girl, and use she/her pronouns initially). That said, gender is not the same as sex, and I feel like the two get mixed up and used interchangeably in the context of pregnancy.

I am REALLY excited to find out the sex of my baby. I can't wait. And while it's not my style, I totally get the many expectant parents who want to find out through a celebration where this very formative piece of information is revealed. I take no issue with ""gender reveals,"" other than the fact that they are ""sex reveals."" Since becoming pregnant, it feels even more important to me that folks call it what it is - doing otherwise reinforces the idea that sex and gender are the same thing, that gender is not fluid, and that there are not gender identities beyond the binary of male and female. It feels like it shuts down options for a child's gender expression to steep an unborn child's existence in a particular gender identity (again, gender, not sex) before they're even born.

I'm not critiquing parents who choose to have a sex reveal where everything is pink or blue, or parents who want to dress their female-sex children in girly dresses with ribbons every single day or drape their male newborns over a football and take pictures of them as the ""next biggest [team] fan."" (I mean, babies are basically adorable tiny human dolls and we gotta put them in all the absolute cutest clothes, male, female, or neutral, before they develop the ability to protest, right?) What bothers me is the mix up of language. Cut into a blue cake at a sex reveal party! Go HAM with the colored confetti in sex reveal balloons! But how can we get folks to call it what it is?

Does anyone else feel this way? Is there a productive and empathetic way to talk about this with each other and other pregnant folks in our lives?",1568159391.0,meinenotyours,True,False,False,0.49,0,164559

Nostalrius and Northdale provided a more authentic Vanilla experience than Blizzard's Classic,196,egj4gc,classicwow,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/egj4gc/nostalrius_and_northdale_provided_a_more/,523,"It’s quite astonishing really.




How in the world does it take Blizzard months to fix Lava Surgers in MC? I still see incorrect animations such as Warriors’ Charge. Private Servers would’ve had such issues fixed within a week or two.



Nobody asked for this nerfed trash 1.12 PvE AV version, yet Blizzard still decided to go with it. Their decision making throughout the span of Classic has been sub impressive.

The fact that there are no BG weekends means the majority of the playerbase is forced to spam AV over and over until AB and BG weekends come out.
Months of just spamming 25+ min queues for this AV PvE nerfed snoozefest every single day in order to climb honor ladder - lovely.

The only reason I’m playing Classic over Private Servers is it’s official meaning I don’t need to worry about the risk of potentially losing my character.
Overall I’d say Vanilla Private Servers were able to provide a better Vanilla experience than what I’ve experienced in Classic.

We're paying $15/month for this.

Before anyone attempts to pinpoint the fact Private Servers weren't 100% Vanilla replicas as a point against them, Private Servers never had the original Vanilla source code / database that Blizzard has.
You're comparing a bloody multi billion dollar company who owns the original game to a bunch of basement dwelling neckbeards. Yet, the latter group had fixed issues at a much faster rate, were more engaged with the community overall, and did more things right. Let that sink in.

Don’t get me started on the issues that have arisen with layering, faction imbalance; realm transfers done piss poorly, server lag, zone-phasing lag and so on and so forth.

Unlike Classic, Vanilla Private Servers:

- Hosted large scale world pvp battles with little to no lag

- Had no layering

- Did not give us nerfed AV

- Were more engaged and active with the community

- Provided a seamless world. There was neither phasing nor lag when you crossed zones

- Arguably had better timelines

- Fixed bugs and issues at a much faster pace than Blizzard devs

There is no excuse for the lack of competence when comparing a multi billion dollar company who owns the original game to a bunch of Frenchies who did not have the resources such as Vanilla source code that Blizzard has.

Spell batching, melee leeway, nerfed AV, incorrect animations, zone phasing lag thanks to the shit modern engine, (and previously layering) have significantly watered down the experience for me.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TLDR** - Classic feels like a fucking glorified bad Private Server that we're paying $15/month for.

Maybe it's just me I don't know. Anyone else feels this way?",1577491260.0,_Falathrin_,True,False,False,0.58,196,424940

This week's [Borderlands 3](https://borderlands.com/locale-redirect.html?url=%2Fshop%2Fborderlands-3-super-deluxe-edition) hotfixes adjust Legendary gear across all manufacturers. Our goal with Legendary gear is to enable a large variety of playstyles and builds for all characters. After looking through the data, we found that that some pieces of Legendary gear were greatly outperforming others and felt they were limiting builds instead of increasing them. In addition, some of the damage output of Legendary gear limited the growth in combat engagements for the future so we tuned everything to an acceptable median. We expect all Vault Hunters to be able to create amazing builds and we want to support that with more ways to grow and reach those power levels.

# Weapon Hotfixes

**Maliwan**

* Westergun damage increased by 25%
* ASMD damage increased by 28%
* Cutsman damage reduced by 25%

**Tediore**

* Ten Gallon damage increased by 8%

**Vladof**

* Sickle reload speed increased by 25%
* Faisor damage increased by 15%
* Infiniti damage increased by 40%
* Magnificent damage increased by 25%
* Jericho damage increased by 40%
* Lucian's Call accuracy and handling reduced
* Lyuda Critical Damage Bonus decreased by 30% and made a modification to address a reported bug that an extra bullet was spawned in the center

*The Lyuda's functionality is to split the projectile from 1 to 3 after a certain distance. It was reported that the original projectile was never destroyed in the process of splitting so 1 projectile actually became 4. Addressing this concern effectively removed a full shot's worth of damage which auto-corrects the base damage of the weapon. Since we increased all sniper rifle critical damage bonus in a previous hotfix, we reduced some of the critical damage bonus on the Lyuda.*

**Torgue**

* Try-Bolt damage increased by 25%
* Alchemist damage increased by 25%
* Devils Foursum damage increased by 13%
* Flakker now consumes the full magazine when fired and damage is reduced by 33%

*Flakker was greatly outperforming other shotguns due to the number of projectiles and the high rate of fire. We initially believed the resulting projectile spread would cause most of the explosions to miss the target, however this turned out to be false, so we reduced the projectile damage and allowed the weapon to only fire once per magazine. This change encourages players to capitalize on different stat bonuses to maximize the weapon's damage output.*

* Laser-Sploder rocket projectiles spawn interval increased by 0.4 seconds

**Jakobs**

* Maggie damage increased by 35%
* Hellwalker damage reduced by 8%

**Hyperion**

*We found that a couple of the Legendary Hyperion weaponry bypassed the Hyperion manufacturer playstyle too easily making their bonuses greatly outweigh the penalties. The Butcher was drastically outperforming all metrics and we chose to reduce the damage in order to keep the fast fire rate.*

* Conference Call damage increased by 15%
* Crossroad accuracy reduced and it now fires 3 projectiles instead of 4
* Butcher accuracy reduced and damage reduced by 25%

**DAHL**

* Vanquisher damage increased by 20%

**Children of the Vault**

* Skeksis damage increased by 15%
* Linoge damage increased by 20%
* Pain is Power damage increased by 25%

**Atlas**

* Ruby's Wrath damage increased by 10%

**Grenades**

*Hex and Firestorm were calibrated to the wrong grenade modifier. These two grenades were envisioned to specialize by applying elemental DoTs to targets. Instead they were resulting in large amounts of damage and the elemental DoTs were minimal. We realize this is a drastic change on both of these grenades, but we did not want to remove the spectacle of the grenade (number of grenades spawned, number of targets hit, etc.) and focused on allowing their core identity to be emphasized instead of them continuing to just be high damage grenades.*

* Hunter-Seeker damage increased by 25%
* Hex grenade damage reduced by 70% and duration reduced to 3 seconds
* Firestorm damage reduced by 70%

**Artifacts**

*It was reported that the Legendary artifact, Elemental Projector, had a bug resulting in the max value being displayed at 183% instead of the actual max value of 113%. Therefore,*  *we addressed the discrepancy and reduced the max value to 90%.*

* Elemental Projector damage max roll reduced to 90%

# Vault Hunter Adjustments

*The current state of Moze's Iron Bear, Zane's Digi-Clone, and FL4K's pets have made players focus on other elements besides those Vault Hunter's fundamental action skills in the late game. While longer term solutions to scaling their damage is explored, we have boosted the health of Iron Bear, the Digi-Clone, and the pets to make them more viable. We will have more to say about long term solutions for these characters in the future.*

* *Iron Bear:* health increased by 50%
* All pets' health increased by 50%
* *Digi-Clone:* health increased by 100%
* Addressed a bug with *Salvation* where grenades were giving life-steal

# Bug Fixes

* Psychos will now use their True Vault Hunter Mode name in True Vault Hunter Mode
* Removed the optional Rare Spawn missions from Galaxy Progress
* Addressed a reported bug where Completely Sane Sid didn't always become hostile when using FL4K
* Addressed a reported bug where Ratch would not properly spawn during ""Ratch'd Up"", which potentially blocked completion of that side mission
* Included a modification so Lilith would continue to move toward the door in Shiv's confession chamber during ""From the Ground Up""
* Lowered the chance for a weapon to drop from the Pachinko machine
* Included a modification so that Zane's Digi-Clone will no longer spawn into the cage in Cistern of Slaughter
* Shield Boosters were modified and are now set for autopickup
* An addition was introduced so Eridium chests are no longer listed as Red Chests in the ECHOcast extension",1571320603.0,borderlands,True,False,False,0.44,0,336380

This is what ruined ESO",4,gb1rwt,fo76,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gb1rwt/bethesda_do_not_impliment_one_appalachia_update/,114,"So for those of you who havent already heard, Bethesda plans to impliment their ""One Appalachia"" update which makes everything scale to your level. But whats the problem? That should be good right? newcomers wont have the issue of getting steamrolled by high level mobs.That is exactly the issue. newcomers SHOULD get steamrolled by high level mobs and low level mobs should still get steam rolled by veterans.

The way ESO's level scaling works is it makes everything ***Exactly*** as powerful as you are. which means trash mobs like zombies are exactly as powerful as generic werewolfs and they are always exactly as powerful as you are untill you get past CP160. making it pointless to have anything beyond green rarity set items until you reach CP160 because they scale to your gear as well. And by the time you've gotten to CP160 you've already completed the game so theres no point in grinding further for the majority of players that are in it for the experience and not the prestige.

I do not want this being the case for fallout 76 as well as not only does it break immersion it breaks the sense of accomplishment newcomers get by making an effort to get more powerful, because any weapon they get, legendary or not is enough to take down anything in their way. There are many people that stopped playing ESO early because a scaling system like this was implemented and they lost interest.

And on top of that I do not want deathclaws and scorchbeasts to be as weak as radroaches or radroaches to be as powerful as deathclaws and scorchbeasts. Deathclaws and scorchbeasts need to remain dangerous encounters because they are dangerous creatures and insects and scorched should remain as weak as the trash mobs they are because they are your dime-a-dozen enemy",1588272829.0,Geeknificent,True,False,False,0.51,4,247088

I just have to get this off my chest,502,f3smoz,pathofexile,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/f3smoz/i_just_have_to_get_this_off_my_chest/,494,"You guys whinge about every goddamn thing. Lag, trade, blood trails, scams, dead league, lab, league mechanics, hard bosses, dying, hardcore, softcore. EVERYTHING. This reddit feels like its one goal is to turn POE into Diablo III.

Cut the crap. POE is hard. But it is fair. Yes you will die. A lot. But you can take steps to die less. Leagues are designed to be played for 3 months. Take your time and do it slowly. Stop rushing to cry here everytime you die. Bosses are meant to be learned. That friend of yours who says he does 80 billion DPS? Fuck him. Make your build tanky enough to do content.

Dev cycles take time and developers are human. They need to rest and recuperate between leagues. Stop with the constant trash talk about buggy leagues. If it bothers you so much start a league one month in. 90% of the issues will be resolved and prices will be cheaper on items.

Trade is meant to be difficult and uncompromising. Lowball some fuckers, there are no fixed prices. You will make money or they will learn pricing. GGG will make it easier to conduct this bargaining process but there will never be an auction house. Deal with it.

Finally I know being negative is a good way to get downvoted. But this sub needs to fucking hear this. Stop crying so much. There's 200% more things to praise in this game. Get some of that shit onto front page. These devs and GGG fucking deserve it.

Edit: A lot of people justifying the constant non stop complaining. No! This post is here to tell you to deal with it. Let this one game be as it is. Go complain and ruin literally any other game. I've seen what happens to games that listen to this constant crying \*points to runescape\*. I hope GGG ignores 90% of the complaints from here. It comes from people who don't know or can't be bothered to put any effort into the game. The devs know what they are doing. They do not need your constant nagging to water this game down to nothing.

Edit 2: seems like I hit the spot and kicked this sub where it hurts and bought all the rats out. Just all the usual suspects doing the same toxic shit they do day in day out. So many people crying, digging for dirt on me, going through my history, complaining again. I completely expected them to miss the point and downvote my thread which they did. But luckily I see that there are more people sick of their constant bitching by quite a few to keep this post alive. Faith in this sub restored.

Edit 3: thanks for the gold.",1581689139.0,Acidburn_33,True,False,False,0.58,502,347884
Confused,1,f3mk74,Astros,https://www.reddit.com/r/Astros/comments/f3mk74/confused/,29,"Cole today stated he’d never seen any of this or knew any of it was going on. If that’s the case, it aligns (mostly) with MLB investigation that they were clean after 2017.  However, his current fan base won’t just give up about it and continue to make buzzer claims.  If they are correct, and we know they aren’t, but if they were, I find it extremely hypocritical that Cole is left out of the constant assault. 

Either they were clean in 2019 or you just paid $300 million for a liar AND a cheat, no?  

All I’m saying is true colors are very evident when you claim someone is cheating, then sign a player and ignore the fact that if you’re right your player is just as guilty.

###New Exotic Minimum Rolls
The loot system is implemented in a way that there are tiers of content based on difficulty. “Normal” is Tier 1 and “Legendary” is Tier 5. The rolls of the dropped items scale in relation to the content Tier. So basically the Tiers define what the minimum rolls are and the distribution between the minimum roll and the max roll.

Exotics are currently implemented in the same way. If you play on normal difficulty, an Exotic can roll very well, but it can also roll very badly because normal has a low minimum roll. 

That will change with the coming update: With TU9 Exotics will drop at least with the minimum-roll of each content Tier. So when you play Challenging Difficulty, you will get better minimum-rolls in comparison to normal or hard difficulty. So there is a reason to play the higher difficulties - because the baseline of the Exotics is better. 

&nbsp;

***
##Reconfiguring Exotics

TU9 will introduce the ability to reconfigure Exotics. This feature will allow you to bring up your lower level Exotics to your current level and improve current Exotics that are already at your current level, providing a continuous purpose for Exotic Components. 

&nbsp;

###**Blueprints**

=> [Image](https://i.imgur.com/wZqde70.jpg)

Reconfigure Blueprints will become available for all Exotics in the game, including the Exotics introduced in the Warlords of New York expansion. As soon as you own a specific Exotic, you can purchase the Reconfigure Blueprint from the crafting Vendor, Inaya. Existing upgrade blueprints you already owned prior to TU9 will be converted into Reconfigure Blueprints automatically and will be available in the Reconfigure section of your crafting bench.

&nbsp;

###**How does it work**

=> [before]( https://i.imgur.com/NfXyQgc.jpg)

=> [after]( https://i.imgur.com/6gAVgCW.jpg)

&nbsp;

The ability to reconfigure an exotic will do 2 things:

1.  The Exotic selected will be brought up to the level of your crafting bench, up to level 40.
2.  The attributes of the Exotic you reconfigure will get new stat values assigned which are appropriate for the Exotic’s level. The overall new power of a reconfigured Exotic will be at a guaranteed minimum and can go all the way up to a god-rolled item.

&nbsp;

The basic idea is, that you have the ability to reroll the entire Exotic and they also guarantee that it will also have pretty high minimum rolls. 

So it will still be a range of rolls but it will be at the upper end. 

There is of course also the risk, that if you already have a very good roll, that the rolls will be lower after the Reconfiguration. 

&nbsp;

###**Costs**

=> [Image](https://i.imgur.com/wZqde70.jpg)

Reconfiguring an Exotic will cost 1 Exotic Component, in addition to the generic crafting materials required for that particular Exotic. 

Deconstructing an Exotic will now yield 1 Exotic Component, down from 2 prior to TU9.

&nbsp;

###**You can do it with level 30 and level 40 Exotics**

When you reconfigure a level 30 Exotic it will become a level 40 Exotic with new rolls and when you do it with a level 40 Exotic, it will just get new rolls.

&nbsp;

###**Reconfigure multiple Times**

You can Reconfigure an Exotic as many times as you want, there are no restrictions. 

&nbsp;

###**Works with Exotics Gear Items and Exotics Weapons**

The Reconfiguration works with all Exotic items, also the crafted ones. 

&nbsp;

###**Old Values have no impact**

If you have a god-rolled level 30 Exotic, it does not have an impact on what rolls it will get at level 40. You basically get a new item. 

That is also the same when you have a max-rolled stat on an Exotic, it is not guaranteed, that this specific stat will also be maxed out after the Reconfiguration. 

&nbsp;

###**Pre-Order Exotics are excluded**

The Exotics like the Lullaby are excluded from that system because they need an existing Exotic as a baseline to be crafted. You will also be able to get a level 40 Lullaby now

&nbsp;

##Season Update

###**The Northeast League is still running.**

*   There are 10 rewards for participating, including the unique “Hyena Tagger” Backpack trophy.
*   League UI improvements were implemented in last week’s update, Title Update 8.5, making the UI clearer when transitioning to a new week.

&nbsp;

*   A new target will arrive later in April.
*   Once a target is available, players have the duration of the Season to hunt them down.

Is it cheating to do continuous fire with non-automatic weapons (such as pistols) by holding on the fire button?,6,cymuu7,truegaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/cymuu7/is_it_cheating_to_do_continuous_fire_with/,61,"Some FPS allow you to continuously fire even with weapons that aren't machine guns and automatic in fire rate such as pistols and M1 Garand Rifle. For example in Return to Castle Wolfenstein I cannot tell you how I can quickly take out groups of Nazi soldiers clustered together with a Luger because I had my finger on the left mouse button and all I had to concentrate on was was moving the aim crosshair before the next round was shot. Because I didn't have to multi task by repeatedly pressing a button than aiming towards the next Nazi's head (which honestly takes away a few seconds per kill and is a big deal if you're in a firefight with a large group of enemies).

I am curious is this considered cheating in speedruns and multiplayer? Especially at professional E-Sports level such as Quakecon?

What are the disadvantages of treating non-automatic weapons such as a shotgun by using automatic gun fire controls by holding the fire button down as you keep on shooting rounds (like you would with a M16 or Chain gun)?

I know many mainstream games such as Call of Duty and Halo distinguish the difference and prevents you from doing this with shotguns, etc. But I am curious how this is frowned upon in competitive gaming and the cons of using this style of gameplay?",1567417110.0,SaturnineSasuke,True,False,False,0.51,6,799085

POLL: adding a PvE mode / removing PvP from Adventure,0,d48cyw,Seaofthieves,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seaofthieves/comments/d48cyw/poll_adding_a_pve_mode_removing_pvp_from_adventure/,1,"_To clarify; and for full disclosure, I would **not** like to see any change to the game, and don’t want to see PvP removed._

Hi everyone,

I’ve seen a real spike in posts requesting a PvE only Adventure mode or for PvP to be removed entirely from Adventure.

I know there’s a constant steady stream of people asking this, but I really wanted to gauge the temperature of the sub on the whole.

So, I’ve compiled a survey, it’s one question, and it’s very simply just trying to gauge the feeling around segmenting the playerbase by adding another Adventure Mode, or removing PvP from adventure all together, and I’d be really grateful if you guys could take the 2/3 seconds to fill it out

[Go here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdELNbaKjzEnMyEy6ej58IRrNfhldJ7spXBkaW31hGmNiQnIw/formResponse)

I’ll probably run this for 48/72 hours and then feed back the results and maybe follow up with a further survey based on the results.

"PSA: Yes, there's server lag in big PvP battles. No, you have no idea what you're talking about.",7,dt755w,classicwow,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dt755w/psa_yes_theres_server_lag_in_big_pvp_battles_no/,82,"* **Argument:** the servers are lagging. Blizzard isn't updating their servers because they don't care.
   * How much RAM or processing power on a server isn't the only thing that affects lag/latency. You can't just throw more resources at the problem. What else affects this?
      * Code: this is an old version of WoW. It might not be as optimized, parallelized, or bug-free.
      * Bandwidth: limited by their internet service provider(s). If their network is too congested, they can't just call their ISP and make them fix it.
* **Argument:** some other private server was able to handle much more than these servers. Blizzard is either incompetent or doesn't care.
   * Did those servers have monitoring, logging, and analytics? Storage and database redundancy? Cyber attack protection? Backend processes for GM support, AH, and instances to prevent lock outs?
   * What would you rather have? Less lag for 200 vs 200 world PvP battles? Or one of these issues:
      * Server crashing
      * Character getting corrupted/lost
      * GMs unable to help you when some character-breaking bug occurs
      * The AH sporadically not working
      * Being unable to join instances/raids because they're ""full""
      * Being unable to log in for extended periods of time
      * Maintenance taking multiple days instead of a few hour
* **Argument:** they have the resources to fix this stuff, they just don't care.
   * How would you know? You know people in their engineering and DevOps department that have tons of free time? Blizzard just has tons of spare employees not working on anything else that they can throw at a problem because 1% of the subscription population can't do huge world PvP battles?

I am not saying they shouldn't attempt to improve the situation. What I am saying is that it's not as easy as you people think it is. If you think that you know what you're talking about, go apply at Blizzard and fix it. No? Then shut the fuck up.  


**Edit:** I don't mean to say that people shouldn't complain. You should. That's one of the great advantages of an online community like this. But you need to change your expectations.

Please use reddit video upload functionality, or free alternatives such as PeerTube @ https://joinpeertube.org/en/

Some exceptions are videos from large open source projects are set to be allowed by automod. Message the mods or reply in this thread if you feel something should be whitelisted. YouTube videos are also still allowed to be linked in comments or as part of a broader post (such as a video demo of related content). Additionally, you can post YouTube mirrors of content in the comments.

There are various reasons that led to this decision:

* YouTube uses a lot of non-free software
* Most YouTube videos posted here are spam
* Lots of YouTube videos are also not even on topic or are a meme
* PeerTube and free software has matured enough to push it over YouTube

Other video sources are currently allowed, although please do consider free software such as the previously mentioned PeerTube.

Edit: Because it appears to need to be said, do not break copyright and upload it to reddit/PeerTube/etc yourself. The content creator will have to do that, so try contacting them, or if you feel it's exceptional it can be modmailed for approval.

Pulled some stats from the last month: 42 total YouTube submission breakdown: 11/42 YouTube links were from regular YouTubers, four of which were related to Pinephone (they seem to be devs although this needs confirming, and in that case they can be whitelisted) and one could have used their alternate link available in their YouTube submission. Another 4/42 were from big projects and are whitelisted. 27/42 were pure spam, with five being from one person and two other individuals using bot submission scripts and one user using multiple accounts to post two times. So, how we can successfully allow the 5/42 that would be removed by the new rule is something that we will take constructive feedback on.

**Exotics**  

*   **Sawyer’s Kneepads** – Reworked  
    [Image](http://static2.cdn.ubi.com/pxm/TCTD2/Forums/tu9/kneepads.jpg)  
      
    
    *   Cannot be staggered by explosions.
    *   Increase total weapon damage by 3% each second you are not moving. Stacks up to 10x and stacks are lost when moving
    *   This exotic only provides defensive attributes and no brand bonus, so now has potential for high damage and makes it appealing to both red and blue builds.
    
      
    _Developer comment: The o__ld version_ _didn’t provide enough engaging gameplay; this change should help with that._

  

*   **Imperial Dynasty** - Buff  
    
    *   Reduced cooldown to 35s (down from 40)
    
      
    _Developer comment:_ _This buff is_ _to better compensate for_ _the_ _lack of brand bonus__._

  

*   **Dodge City Gunslinger**  
    
    *   Reduced charge up time 30s (from 50s)

*   **Diamondback** – Reworked  
    [Image](http://static2.cdn.ubi.com/pxm/TCTD2/Forums/tu9/diamondb.jpg)  
      
    
    *   Now Grants all shots guaranteed crits for 5s after hitting a mark
    
      
    _Developer comment: The Diamondback_ _is underperforming,_ _and this change should make the bonus a bit more exciting._

  

*   **Merciless/Ruthless** – Buff  
    
    *   Explosion damage increased to 1200% (up from 900%)
    
      
    _Developer comment: Explosion Damage doesn’t scale with crit stats, so boosted to compensate_.

  

*   **Lady Death**  
    *   No longer enhances Turret Skills.
*   **Bullet King**  
    *   Base damage is now the same as the non-exotic LMG version.
*   **Exotic attribute roll quality**  
    *   All exotics will now roll at the highest possible minimum roll regardless of the difficulty they are obtained in.  
        *   Exotic items can still roll higher than the minimum but minimum rolls are now higher.

&nbsp;
  
###**Talents**  

*   **Tag Team** - Reworked  
    *   The last enemy you have damaged with a skill is marked.
    *   Dealing weapon damage to that enemy consumes the mark to reduce active cooldowns by 6s.
    *   Cooldown: 4s
    *   Does not consume mark if no skill is on cooldown.
*   **Reassigned** – Buff  
    *   Killing an enemy adds 1 round of a random special ammo into your sidearm.
    *   Reduced cooldown to 15s (down from 20s).

    *   Enemies that walk within 3m of your hive, turret, or remote pulse are shocked.

*   **Empathic Resolve** - Buff  
    
    *   Repairing an ally, increases their total weapon and skill damage by 3-15% for 20s (up from 10s). 1-7% if self.
    
      
    _Developer comment:_ _Currently it is difficult to keep_ _a high uptime in 4-man content as non-tank players try to be as safe as possible_ _and NPCs have higher lethality, so chip damage is less frequent._

&nbsp;
  
**Creeping Death**  

*   When you apply a status effect, it is also applied to all enemies within 8m (up from 5m) of your target.
*   Reduced cooldown to 15s (down from 20s).

&nbsp;
  
###**Weapons**  

*   **Assault Rifles:**
    *   Increased maximum roll of Damage to Health to 21%.  
        *   Players on Stadia will not see this be displayed correctly and instead see an increase to Damage to Health on other weapon types. This is an UI issue only and will be fixed with the next client update.
  
&nbsp;

###**Gear Sets**  

*   **True Patriot**  
    *   White buff armor repair lowered to 2%/3% once every second.

&nbsp;
  
###**Main Missions**  

*   **Pentagon & Darpa Research Lab**

&nbsp;
  
###**AI & NPCs**  

*   **Signature Weapons Against Named NPCs**  
    *   Slightly increased damage signature weapons deal to named enemies
*   **Elite NPCs Damage Against Player Skills**  
    *   Reduced damage elite NPCs deal to player skills.
*   **Tank Sprint Speed**  
    *   Reduced sprint speed of Tank archetype from all hostile factions
*   **NPC Shotguns**  
    *   Reduced damage of all NPC shotguns
    *   Adjusted range of some NPC shotguns (including shotguns used by Black Tusk Rusher)
*   **Status Effects**  
    *   Reduced duration of Poison and Cleaners' Napalm Ensnare (when applied to players)
*   **Special Ammo Signaling**  
    *   Any NPC with special ammo has the same UI indication as from the Special Ammo Directive.
    *   Examples of who this affects:  
        *   Outcasts who pick up special ammo from boxes deployed by their Support archetype.
        *   Bounties who spawn with special ammo.
*   **Rogue Agents**  
    *   Significantly reduced the armor of dynamically spawning Rogue Agents.  
        *   To prevent this from being too large of a nerf in 3-4-player co-op a Rogue Agent can spawn with an armor kit which can repair their armor up to 70%.
    *   Slightly reduced the damage output of dynamically spawning Rogue Agents.
*   **NPC Buff Allies Ability Changed**  
    *   Previously, certain bosses and bounties would magically overheal themselves and their fireteam. This “buff allies” ability lacked clear messaging, so it has been replaced with a “leader overheal” ability. This is the same ability that the Rikers’ Leader archetype has. Once the boss (leader) is killed, all their friendlies lose their overheal. The UI indicator of pulsating circles inward/outward in their nameplate signals when this ability is active. 

&nbsp;
  
###**Loot/Rewards**  

*   Increased power of dropped Exotics to always be of the highest tier, giving the highest minimum rolls.
*   Added Operation Dark Hours raid gear set Chest and Backpack items to the general loot pool, making them available outside of Operation Dark Hours.
*   Lowered number of Exotic Components awarded from Exotic deconstruction to match the cost of Exotic reconfiguring.
*   Lowered Conflict XP amount from PVP weekly projects to match the required XP for 1 Conflict level.

&nbsp;
  
###**Blueprints**  

*   Combined all Skill Mod blueprints of different qualities into a single blueprint per Skill, scaling quality with that of the Crafting Bench.
*   Added Skill Mod Blueprints for the Skills introduced in Warlords of New York.
*   Added Blueprints from the general Blueprints pool to first-time weekly completion rewards of Invaded Missions.
*   Added Blueprints from the general Blueprints pool to the rewards of Daily Projects.

&nbsp;
  
###**Skills**  

*   The Sharpshooter’s Tactician Skill base radius has been increased to 50m.
*   Scoping is now enabled when using a Shield Skill.

&nbsp;

###**Achievements**  

*   Changed the trophy requirements for ""Dark Zone: Safe House"" to be unlocked by visiting any Safe House in the DZ.

&nbsp;

"Dragon Quest XI s is as good as BOTW, yet has sold very little in the west. This game deserves better.",62,e3fp8g,NintendoSwitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/e3fp8g/dragon_quest_xi_s_is_as_good_as_botw_yet_has_sold/,324,"This game is fantastic. It just exudes love, care and respect to the player. So much to do- yet the pacing is great and not overwhelming.
So many difficulty options to tailor the game to your preference.
The characters are so endearing. The art style is gorgeous, specifically the enemy design.
It's probably the best RPG I've played. Ever. I absolutely rate it at the same level as BOTW, Odyssey, Smash Bros and the like. 

Yet it's sales in the west are at about 600,000-700,000, from what I understand. They haven't sold 1 mil. This is a real shame, and I hope more people will give this game a shot.

It's really well known by now who much this series is revered in japan, and for really good reason. It deserves to be a worldwide phenomenon.
 
So, anyway- I guess this is just me really recommending this game and urging others to give it a shot. If you have even the slightest affinity for JRPGs, you should give it a shot. You'll probably love it.

Edit: OK, so all you people telling me I can't compare the games are missing the point. If you notice my post- I am not comparing them, not really in an in-depth way. I am just saying that for me it's as good and as fun as many top tier switch games. I'm saying that this game could be mentioned along side other top tier switch games. I even gave other examples in my post like Odyssey and Smash. People seem to have no issue with those games being mentioned in the same breath as Zelda, even though they are totally different games as well. 

The point of this post if to say that I think a lot more people could enjoy this game than then currently are, and that it is surprising to me that it's not selling more in the west.",1575039228.0,the7thbeatle,True,False,False,0.55,62,1991115

"/r/ItsAFetish - a subreddit dedicated to the hoax pseudoscience that transgender people are ""just a fetish"", breaking their own sub rules; highly upvoting racist, sexist bigotry and hatred; violating the Reddit Content Policy against Harassment; platforming White Supremacist ecosystem users …",0,czt73a,AgainstHateSubreddits,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/czt73a/ritsafetish_a_subreddit_dedicated_to_the_hoax/,12,"In the wake of the posts yesterday about /r/ParadigmShift2070 (which is now *shuttered*, thanks to the efforts of /r/AgainstHateSubreddits),

There was discussion in the comments of one of the posts about the subreddit /r/ItsAFetish - a subreddit dedicated to claiming that transgender people are ""simply"" suffering from a psychological illness of paraphilia, that ""being transgender"" is a *fetish*.

This view was held by a significant portion of the medical community for a few decades - it's termed the *Blanchardian hypothesis* or the *Blanchardian taxonomy*, and has been set aside by the medical community as harmful and representative of a few researchers imposing their personal beliefs on the treatment of transgender people who need medical assistance.

The fact that this hypothesis has been removed from use by the medical community does not stop the bigots who were relying upon it, and /r/ItsAFetish -- along with its sibling subreddit, /r/NeoVaginaDisasters -- both offshoots of the anti-transgender hate subreddit /r/GenderCritical -- came into being.

Yesterday, I discussed with someone in the comments of a post, here, the potential for putting work into reporting the content of the subreddit, to work towards it being quarantined.

In response, one of the users of /r/ItsAFetish took a screenshot of the exchange, poorly censored it, and posted it.

[These are the (properly censored) screenshots of their thread, usernames censored, with the RES tags I use intact -- to demonstrate the activity in the post and subreddit - where they rampantly upvote homophobic stereotypes, misogyny, cruelty, and personal attacks, as well as violate the Reddit Content Policy against Harassment.](https://imgur.com/a/OEM10sm)

Tag Key:

""Part"" - Participant   
""Mod"" - ""Moderator""  
""IAF"" - /r/ItsAFetish  
""NVD"" - /r/NeoVaginaDisasters  
""ClownEmojiWorldEmoji"" - Clownworld ecosystem subreddit

""PS2070"" - /r/ParadigmShift2070 - shut down due to AHS efforts  
""SFWPO"" - SubForWhitePeopleOnly  
""GC""  - /r/GenderCritical  
""Apus"" - Undisclosed ""Frenworld"" ban evasion subreddit that begins with the string ""Apus"".  

---

The relevant rules of /r/ItsAFetish:

Rules:

1. Radfem/GC ideology is assumed and not up for debate. Alt-righters, MRAs, and incels aren't welcome here. ...

2. No cruelty, misogyny, sexism, racism, homophobia, ableism. Snarkiness and critique are allowed and encouraged but cruelty is not. Don't use trans and misogynist slurs. Feel free to express anger and annoyance; no viciousness or comments calling for harm unto others.

3. Edit identifying info out of screenshots. Don't doxx or brigade. Use np or archive.is links. To create a non participation link, replace the www in a reddit url with np. Click here to create an archive link (preferably from old.reddit or np.reddit).

4. Participate in good faith. No trolling, flaming, spamming, personal attacks, threatening, etc.

---

First screenshot notes:

The users of /r/ItsAFetish ""discuss"" why the subreddit being Quarantined would be unfair, ""fascist"", and tantamount to censorship.

Note the ""If you don't like us promoting hatred under the guise of hoax pseudo-science, you can just leave"" victim-blaming voted to the top of the ""discussion"", along with advocacy of cruelty (""The world is not a safe space"").

Clearly the ""Rules"" for the subreddit exist as a fig leaf, to deflect criticism and a full evaluation of the actual practices of the subreddit.

---

Second screenshot notes:

Second-most highly voted comment from a user with a blatantly racist username, violating rule 1 of the subreddit -- with content that is a racist, sexist stereotype, followed up with homophobia. Rules 1 and 2 of the IAF sub, broken in one comment. Third comment is by a user of the now-shuttered ban-evasion ""ClownWorld"" white supremacist subreddit ParadigmShift2070 -- breaking rules 1 and 2 of the subreddit (and thus, rule 4 of the sub).

---

Third screenshot notes:

""Quarantining a subreddit dedicated to hatred, highly shocking or offensive content, or hoax pseudo-science, or all three -- is censorship"" would have taken up less screen real estate. Also, complaining about violations of the Reddit Content Policy against Harassment, while participating in a subreddit that is hosting a post that is engaged in a violation of the Reddit Content Policy against Harassment. IAF Rules 2, 3 and 4, violated.

---
Fourth screenshot notes:

""The very definition of bigotry"", from a WatchRedditDie and IAmGoingToHellForThis user (masstagger tag not visible in this screenshot due to server load). More ""If you don't like us promoting hatred, shocking & offensive content, and hoax pseudo-science, just don't look - this doesn't concern you"" victim-blaming bully mentality.

Also note the comment at the bottom, written by a heavy participant in SubForWhitePeopleOnly - an openly neonazi subreddit that has been quarantined. Rule 1 and 2 of IAF broken.

---
Fifth screenshot notes:

Credit where credit's due: ""This is anti-semitic"" by a PS2070 user was downvoted.

---
Sixth screenshot notes:

Next top-level comment, at 86 points, is a celebration and encouragement of scraping my comment history -- proof that this post is a violation of the Reddit Content Policy against Harassment, and a violation of Rule 3 of the IAF subreddit. Follow that up with the ParadigmShift2070 user (violation of rule 1 of the IAF rules) posting a ClownWorld dogwhistle, ""fren"" - 10 upvotes.

---
Seventh screenshot notes:

""All relationships / dating require sex as a mandatory part"" is a pretty rapey, misogynistic, sexist, bigoted, rapey vibe. Did I mention rapey? Yeah. 31 points and 70 points. IAF rules violated: 2 and 4

---
Eighth screenshot notes:

There's the appearance by one of the ItsAFetish ""moderators"", eschewing the moral core of IAF rules 2 and 4. It's a conscience-free, philosophy! /r/ItsAFetish!

The [deleted][removed] comment was created by a misogynistic-shock-porn-posting account that had previously harassed me, including creating a subreddit dedicated to harassing me with ""sissy porn"" content, and doxxing me. That account had been previously reported to the Reddit Administration for action and the admins took ""appropriate"" action -- but apparently not enough. The removed comment contained personally identifiable information about me, gloated about me being raped, and was removed by Reddit Anti-Evil -- not by IAF ""moderators"".

---
Ninth screenshot notes:

ParadigmShift2070 user (Rule 1) celebrating subreddit and sitewide ban evasions via throwaway/ sockpuppet accounts for the purpose of violating Reddit Content Policy against Harassment - 47 upvotes.

---
Tenth screenshot notes:

IAF mod making an appearance again, in a thread dedicated to violating Rule 3 of the subreddit (and the Reddit Content Policy against Harassment), surrounded by comments from users that break rules 1, 2, and 4 of the subreddit.

---
Eleventh screenshot notes:

""Personally I like you guys as opposed to those g-d dirty frog and clown subs"", by a user of /r/ParadigmShift2070 (clownworld sub) and an Apu (frenworld) sub. Bonus for the openly anti-Semitic ""SHUT IT DOWN"" dogwhistle. The general tone of ""It's wrong to quarantine a subreddit dedicated to hate, highly shocking or offensive content, or hoax pseudo-science"" continues throughout.

---
Twelfth screenshot notes:

End of the thread.

My aim in this post is to persuade you, the audience of /r/AgainstHateSubreddits, that /r/ItsAFetish (and its sibling subreddit, /r/NeoVaginaDisasters [warning: contents are highly graphic and disturbing]) : 

* qualify as hate subreddits (their ""rules"" mean nothing; they host hate rhetoric and users from hate subreddits; they permit and encourage violations of the Reddit Content Policy against Harassment);

* They're worth the effort to report their contents, in order to persuade the administration of Reddit, Inc. to *at least* Quarantine them.

This is a view of *one* post in /r/ItsAFetish. It is, however, representative of the kind and manner of content of the subreddit.

This was created as a set of screenshots and not a link to the thread, in order to stave off accusations by the showrunners of /r/ItsAFetish that I (or /r/AgainstHateSubreddits) aided or induced vote manipulation or harassment of the users in that subreddit or thread.

In the strongest possible terms:

**_Do Not Participate In The /r/ItsAFetish Subreddit_**. 

If you *choose* to help the effort to have Reddit's administration take action, please use https://www.reddit.com/report and link to the offending content (where **This is Abusive or Harassing -> It's Rude, Vulgar, or Offensive** is the report flow to use, by default - or use the appropriate report flow for the reported content)

The delay would completely overshadow their conference. They would have gotten that out of the way before hand. Second, Nintendo has consistently continued to list animal crossing as a 2019 game so they still intend to release it this year, and I trust Nintendo to know if they can get that done. 

People have tried to compare animal crossing to two other Switch games that got delayed - fire emblem and yoshi. However, this is a terrible comparison because neither fire emblem or yoshi are made by Nintendo. They are made by much smaller studios who are also much less competent. The only Nintendo 1st party game that has been delayed on recent years is breath of the wild, which was obviously pushed back to release on the switch.",1559832974.0,Gybgbb,True,False,False,0.51,11,1991115

Too much negativity here - I still lime FO76,0,dn1n2b,fo76,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dn1n2b/too_much_negativity_here_i_still_lime_fo76/,125,"I like FO76.

Rarely post on Reddit.  My opinion on FO76 and latest update...

Many issues were unfairly overhyped on Reddit and YouTube.  None of these “game-breaking” issues made a significant negative impact on my personal gaming experience.

There are problems - many were fixed.  Some were not and some will not.  Some present an opportunity for monetization.

I understand that Bethesda is not “my friend that betrayed me”.  It’s a corporation whose prime responsibility is to make money (ideally making an enjoyable product). I also appreciate that no corporation will invest money into product development unless it (and its shareholders) will make a profit.  

It doesn’t take a business genius to figure out that after investing approx. 100mil into the game and selling less than 3mil copies, Bethesda needs a way to make money on FO76 - especially with the ongoing Operating Expenses.   (Actually, I am pleasantly surprised that the title wasn’t dropped by developer like some other games that didn’t have a happy start).

I like the Fallout franchise. I like FO76 and the potential it has.  I enjoyed hundreds of hours of gameplay and continue to enjoy my time in FO76. I don’t want to wait another 5 years for the next FO game title - I want this title to work out and will support FO76 as long as I am playing it.

I saw some folks asking last time FTT was up, so I'll clarify once more: as long as you keep it SFW and otherwise civil, anything goes! It doesn't have to be League-related, but it can be if you want it to be!

"Mozilla's lack of respect for FireFox's users is going to drive me and others away, likley to Chromium based browsers.",0,gh7b22,firefox,https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/gh7b22/mozillas_lack_of_respect_for_firefoxs_users_is/,111,"Edit: I find this Bugzilla guideline fitting of Mozilla’s attitude towards users. “No whining about decisions. If another project contributor has marked a bug as INVALID, then it is invalid...Unless you have further evidence to support reopening a bug, do not post a comment arguing that a bug resolved as INVALID or WONTFIX should be reopened.” 

Links to noted issues and past performance issues have been added. Fixed up text written on mobile. 

**TLDR:** Mozilla needs to actively listen to FireFox users and implement features that we want in our browser. Mozilla needs to engage with FireFox users in forums and on social media. Mozilla needs to allow users to decide the direction for major changes to the FireFox browser (UI, connectivity, etc.). If Mozilla does not fulfill our desires for a fast and modern browser, many of us will move elsewhere leading to an even smaller market share for FireFox.

Mozilla has been pushing FireFox UI changes down our throats. I have had few issues with most of the changes until the ""Wonderful Bar"" was implemented. The issues of this search bar have been well discussed in the FireFox community. Ultimately, it has degraded my user experience with FireFox and if I had not found a way to disable it, I would have left FireFox for good.

Mozilla has had a number of blunders with FireFox over the past 3 years.

1. The add-on fiasco that resulted in tons of add-ons not working for users due to some security update (Firefox disabled all add-ons because a certificate expired (updated), May 3 2019, https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-03-firefox-extension-add-on-cert.html)

2. The removal of  support for legacy add-ons. I understand this was necessary for security and efficiency purposes. (FireFox no longer supported certain frameworks like SDX and SUL starting in FireFox 57, https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/frequently-asked-questions-firefox-addon#w_what-is-a-legacy-extension)

3. The “Awesome”/Mega Bar"" drastically changing the search/url bar of the browser, making it difficult for users to see information on their webpages. (Plenty of posts all over this subreddit mostly complaining about this change since it was implemented.) 

3a. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/gerpeu/browserurlbarupdate1_false_no_longer_getting_rid/)   

3b. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/fxorxi/dear_mozilla_we_need_to_chat/) 

3c. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/gciw11/im_so_disappointed_i_just_updated_to_750_and_im/) 

3d. [Megathread Here with 1300 comments so as of May 11th.](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/fwhlva/address_barawesomebar_design_update_in_firefox_75/) 

Apart from these, FireFox (in my experience) has a number of long term issues:

* FireFox is slow compared to Chrome and other browsers. (Edit: Specifically FireFox takes longer (from a few milliseconds to a few seconds) to load many websites (even non-Google/Facebook sites).

* FireFox takes longer to start-up. (Chrome starts almost immediately after I click the icon. Old Edge and Chromium Edge both start almost immediately after clicking the icon. FireFox sometimes will start quickly, sometimes it will take a few seconds.

* FireFox eats huge amounts of RAM for no apparent reason. (Especially on YouTube (Yes I am aware that Google purposely neglects FireFox compatibility in anyway possible, especially on YouTube). Every week or so there are posts on this subreddit about users asking why FireFox is using X GB of RAM when they have a few tabs open.) 

* FireFox is not compatible/supported by ~20% of websites. (Edit: Apart from Google sites that break easily when using FireFox, the browser struggles to have website developers optimize their sites for use in FireFox. Video players not functioning, scrolling difficulties, issues signing in to sites, sites clearly stating that FireFox is not supported and that users should use Chrome, etc.)

* FireFox has difficulty rendering videos with the same fluidity as Chromium based browsers (especially on YouTube due to Google).
* FireFox has an outdated password management system. It has had some improvements during the Lockwise rebranding, but it still does not work well compared to the plentiful number of password managers out there.

**Worst of all,** FireFox bugs and issues are frequently ignored by Mozilla for years or decades. Mozilla frequently places the onus and fault on users if FireFox is not functioning well. Even in this subreddit, users are scolded if they have not disabled certain features, adjusted advanced settings in about:config (which 90% of normal (nontechnical) users don't even know exists) or filed a Bug Report on BugZilla. Notwithstanding the fact that many bugs are buried and ignored by Mozilla and the FireFox development team.

**I love FireFox** and I love that FireFox is out there as an opensource and progressive alternative to the monopoly of Chromium browsers. Few other browsers beyond Brave and FireFox take user's right to privacy so seriously. We need browsers like FireFox to exist. **But**, I do not see a long term future for FireFox when Mozilla actively pushes features and products that users do not want, do not like and do not need, while neglecting the most important aspects of the browser, **speed &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; performance**. To most people, not much else matters. Privacy settings are important to me, but not to the point that I will use a subpar, clunky and unsupported browser.

If the senior Mozilla staff come across this post, please consider reaching out more frequently to the FireFox community and engage in conversations with us on Reddit and other platforms. Maybe then we will understand the reasons behind your actions, and maybe then you will further understand what we want and need in FireFox.

Unpopular opinion: There is nothing wrong with reserves.,11,dlkl9k,classicwow,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dlkl9k/unpopular_opinion_there_is_nothing_wrong_with/,204,"All the time, both around here and ingame, I see people crying and whining about reserves. If you don't like someone's reserve, don't join that group. What's the problem? What's stopping you from making your own group with no reserves? It's just pointless whining and shitposting about how other people run their groups.

I personally tank DM East jump runs with the Thorium veins reserved, and have had people whine at me for being ""greedy"". Uh...no, there's literally nothing in there that I need except the thorium veins. I'm putting together a group, tanking a dungeon that I don't need any gear from, and allowing other people to get their preraid gear in exchange for the thorium veins at the end. What's so ""greedy"" about that? You can't even get the thorium veins unless you're a Miner anyway.

When it comes to people reserving gear, again, what is stopping you from just making your own group? Typically the things on reserve are very low droprate items, like Ironfoe, or HoJ, or dal'rends. People don't want to run the instance 30+ times, finally have it drop, and then lose the roll. It's not ""greedy"" or ""elitist"" or ""entitled"" to not want your time wasted.

Another example from me, I tanked Arena/Angerforge farm groups with HoJ reserved. The DPS ended up being Mage/Warlock and a Warrior who already had HoJ. No complains, run went smooth, mage got his spell hit sash and I got my HoJ after 4 runs.

By announcing a reserve up-front, you're making the loot rules completely clear so that people know what they're getting into. Would you rather people just not say anything, and then suddenly change the loot to master looter before the boss dies and take the item you thought you were going to roll on? No, that'd be horrible.

If this is fun and games then its not my job to spoil the fun right? Well then why are female wrestlers treated so differently?

Mention something about Bayley's ass? Get called a creep. Charlotte's breasts? Same thing. Same with Mandy Rose, Alexa or Rhea. And dont get me started on japanese ladies.

Why is it okay to post ""face fuck me finn!"" But not to say ""X's ass looks great in this pic"" if it refers to girl?

Is this some case of whiteknights downvoting these comments and getting upset? What do you say about Scarlett Bordeaux whose sexual behavior is big part of her gimmick?

[MegaThread] Addressing Sinophobia and China’s Coronavirus Response,24,evwqxz,Sino,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sino/comments/evwqxz/megathread_addressing_sinophobia_and_chinas/,32,"Comrades all over our communities, on Reddit and IRL, have most likely saw the direct and incognito attacks on Chinese culture, people, and communities. [It is no surprise that when the United States has an enemy, racism, scapegoatism, and bigotry certainly follows.](https://np.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/evpfk6/rant_about_the_sudden_rise_in_sinophobia/)

I want to make a megathread that not only beat backs those sinophobic attacks and understand the virus but also praises the very culture and government these Westerners attempt to discredit. 

**1.) Where did the virus come from and scapegoating Chinese culinary diets.**

[""The origin of the new coronavirus is the wildlife **sold illegally** in a Wuhan seafood market,"" Gao Fu, director of China Center for Disease Control and Prevention.](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202001/21/WS5e266cb4a310128217272837.html). However, there is some speculation that [it may not have even came from food](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00180-8). Contrary to Westerners' portrayal of Chinese cuisine, these markets are, in fact, illegal in China, and are not “more popular” in this region. In fact, there is a huge problem of illegal exotic meat markets all over the world, especially the rise of it in the West: 

- [Here's an article about illegal exotic meat markets in the UK and the dangers of becoming a potential ""global pandemic""](https://qz.com/795294/will-illegal-bushmeat-bring-the-next-global-outbreak/).

- Funny enough, [Fox news reported on an couple of illegal exotic meat market in Illinois USA, and one of the butchers liking rattlesnake](https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/meat-scandals-highlight-growing-taste-for-exotic-animals). 

- [Just a funny tid bit, here Binging with Babbish getting almost every kind of exotic meat he can find for his 2 million subscriber special](https://youtu.be/Mf4wwXM2o_M?t=113).  

However, Westerners use Sinophobic stereotypes to target China's cuisine and blame them for spreading the virus, despite this potentially coming from other **illegal** exotic markets. [Although mostly about MSG, this video explores the racist and sinophobia surrounding Chinese cuisine, where they even have a clip where Anthony Bourdain said ""you know what causes Chinese Restaurant Syndrome? Racism""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm8Yx-gWlMs). Also, there was a piece of fake news circulating of a Chinese women eating a bat, when, in fact, [she was in Palau, an archipelago in the western Pacific *3 years ago.*](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3047683/sorry-about-tasty-bat-chinese-online-host-apologises-travel-show). 

It is obvious that the West is simply attempting to pile on more of its patented racism onto another country that is a target of its capitalistic government. From Muslim slayers to Muslim protectors, the West weaponizes its racism through individuals' behaviors and applies as it sees fit. Western culture is founded on bigotry and scapegoating, surrounding itself with individualistic economic systems that will ultimately be its own demise.

Iraqis, Venezuelans, Chinese, Iranians, and now back to Chinese; the West's focused racism is like a flavor of the month. But China is becoming a bigger and bigger target because of its unstoppable economic power and influence that threatens Western hegemony.

Sinophobia is only going to get worse from here. There needs to be a greater campaign to push against this bigotry, and challenge such disgusting cultural elements in the West.

**2.) The virus itself**

The Conoravirus is an mRNA virus that attacks the repertory systems in mammals, including humans.  Although it is a fast spreading disease that has a 10-14 day incubation period (making it more difficult to detect), **there is only a 3% fatality rate.**. There are currently 7,259 confirmed cases and 169 deaths, most of which have been those between the ages of 35-90, with the average being around 75. More information about the virus can be found [here](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Along with this, people have been recovering and “being cured” by having their immune systems simply fight it off (with the help of hospitals and medical teams). See [here](https://www.ladbible.com/news/news-man-who-recovered-from-coronavirus-explains-what-deadly-virus-is-like-20200122) and [here](https://www.rt.com/news/479108-first-cononavirus-patient-cured/).  Additionally, [the coronavirus outbreak may reach its peak in one week or around 10 days, renowned Chinese respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan said](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/28/c_138739773.htm). 

 [To compare, “Flu-related illnesses the week of Jan. 18 spiked to nearly 15 million cases nationwide as health officials from the Centers for Disease Control reported an additional 1,400 deaths since last week — 15 of which were of children.”](https://patch.com/washington/across-wa/u-s-flu-cases-spike-15-million-flu-report-washington) 

**3.) The Government's response has been strong and effective in stopping and curing the Coronavirus** 

Westerners have been complaining about the governments slow and oppressive response to stopping the Coronavirus, even going so far as to say they deserve it. Despite the [the World Health Organization is praising the Chinese government’s quick response to the crisis, with director-general Tedo Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying the country was taking “very strong measures…with full commitment. We are in agreement with Chinese authorities who have been clear and transparent…”](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/who-says-will-decide-on-thursday-if-china-virus-is-a-global-health-emergency)

Here are a couple of highlights of what the government has done to halt the spread (most come from this [article](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/chinas-coronavirus-response-shows-whats-possible-when-people-come-before-profits/) here):

-	Only a week after the coronavirus outbreak, China State Construction Engineering has already begun speedbuilding a new, specialised 25,000m2 public hospital with 1,000 beds from the ground up: aiming to open it to patients in under 11 days.


-	[Another 1,300 bed hospital being built]( https://np.reddit.com/r/Sino/comments/eu9fi2/coronavirus_epidemic_update_construction_of/)


-	[China is on the verge of obtaining a vaccine, being able to isolate the virus and fast-tracking manufacturing within 40 days to start clinical trials](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/28/c_138739378.htm) 



-	[Curtailing price gouging and hording vital products for outbreak, as profiteering from crisis is banned,  and regulators set up a hotline for consumers to report violators](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202001/25/WS5e2c06d9a31012821727337c.html) 



-	[Successfully quarantine major cities, to where, again World Health Organization said cutting off a city as large as Wuhan is ""unprecedented in public health history"" and praised China for its incredible commitment to isolate the virus and minimize the spread to other countries.](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).



-	450 medical staff from the People’s Liberation Army are now on the way to Wuhan to provide relief to doctors and nurses there along with hundreds more giving up their new years to help with the relief. 


But what has been Westerner’s response [TW: Racism, Sinophobia]?

-	[Government is not doing anything, so village builds a wall](https://np.reddit.com/r/ShitLiberalsSay/comments/evmoin/china_isnt_doing_anything_so_its_a_bioweapon/) 

-	[China allocated $8 billion in emergency funds to Wuhan yet some medical supplies like N95 masks are in short supply b/c they're patented by US companies.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Sino/comments/eup6r4/china_allocated_8_billion_in_emergency_funds_to/)

-	To a “non-western” extent, Hong Kong protesters [bombed a hospital](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3047744/home-made-bomb-explodes-hong-kong-caritas-medical) and [set fire to a building attempting to house the infected](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-hong-kong-protests-china-12348984). 

-	[And, of course, reddit’s sinophobia](https://np.reddit.com/r/ShitLiberalsSay/comments/evaxyv/i_hate_reddit_why_does_this_dumb_joke_get_8/). 

[Instead of sympathizing and helping those in need with this crisis, rampant bigotry against Chinese communities, and the hypocrisy with other emergencies is incredible.](https://i.imgur.com/Vsn8jNy.jpg). 

But this has all gotten to the point, where even [foreign immigrants in Wuhan state “Seeing the reactions from outside world, especially in western media, racist, political comments and so on is so disgusting, people should stop this.”](https://thenanjinger.com/news/national-news/wuhan-expats-fed-up-with-foreign-media-hype/). 

**Conclusion**

China’s coronavirus response shows what’s possible when people come before profits. This is a title of an article that hits the nail on the head. [I can only imagine what the US response may be when it comes to this](https://np.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/euva14/dont_forget_also_that_this_was_happening_during/). From the article:

> Party General Secretary Xi Jinping, who is also president of China, chaired the meeting. “Life is of paramount importance,” he said. “When an epidemic breaks out, a command is issued. It is our responsibility to prevent and control it.” He said that party members at all levels and across the country must “stand on the frontline” to safeguard public health… 

> The paper called the crisis “a test for China’s governance system and capability,” saying it was especially urgent to guarantee the storage and supply of drugs and medical supplies. “China, as the world’s factory, does not lack a production force, and filling the current supply gaps is not a difficult matter. We call on the relevant parties to put the pedal to the floor to guarantee production, and urge every city in the country to offer mutual assistance to get through the challenge.”

> On Wall Street, meanwhile, profit rather than public health was the focus. In New York, the stocks of airlines, travel companies, casinos, and tourism-oriented companies were down in Friday trading as investors worried about how the China travel freeze could impact margins. This downward pressure was balanced, however, by eager financial advisers telling their clients to buy shares in companies that manufacture masks and medical supplies and biotech firms that make vaccines—especially as the United States reported its first case of the coronavirus.

> The contrasting responses of government and Communist Party officials in China and that of Wall Street investors puts the distinction between the socialist and capitalist systems in sharp relief and prompts the question: Which comes first—people or profits?

When it got to me I mentioned I watched Louis CK's new stand up special and how I was glad to see him back. Everyone got mostly quiet after.

My boss then says she is disappointed to hear I am pro rape culture. I didnt really know what to say, or if I should defend myself. I just said Im not pro rape anything, and that yea what he did was weird but I didnt really think it was wrong. She just said something like she was lost for words and left the call. The meeting ended shortly after, and I pretty much knew I was fucked.

This morning I had a not so surprise meeting with HR and the CEO. The CEO said she was disapointed in my behavior and said that my boss and her no longer feel safe having me as part of the team after what I said. I was really lost for words, didnt really even defend myself and just said ok and sorry they felt this way.
